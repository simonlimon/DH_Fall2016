44,,,,,,"44.2 TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [CH. 24 eminence on this subject to decry the work of the North-West from the Gandhara period onwards, treating its productions as little more than pale and effete reﬂex— ions of classical prototypes, and claiming for Hindustan and Central India virtually the whole credit for the great outburst of formative art {which distinguished the Gupta School. We know now from these remains at Taxilagthat, whatever Hellenistic tradition may have lingered on into the ﬁfth century, the Indo-Afghan School was anything but a mimetic one. It was conservative to the extent that it perpetuated many of the orthodox forms of Buddhist imagery, but it was essentially a living art, instinct with new energy and creative power, and it made most valuable contributions to the later art of Hindustan and Central India. The time when it may truly be said that art at Taxila was mainly an imitation of Hellenistic art was during the Parthian period, and we have only to turn to the stucco ﬁgures of that period from Sirkap to understand how degenerate Hellenistic art could become in the hands of Indian imitators who had no creative genius of their own. Three centuries later conditions had entirely changed: the sculptors of the Indo-Afghan School were still making use here and there of Hellenistic motifs and ideas, but only to assimilate them into the body of their own art, which in its own way was just as original, forceful and independent as the Gupta art of Hindu— stan and more so than contemporary Byzantine art in the West. Some general remarks on the terra—cottas from the Bhir Mound will be found in vol. I at pp. Io4-5, 108, III; and on those from Sirkap at pp. 127—8, 133, 203, 208—9.

No arms; the legs end in a point immediately below the thighs, the division between them being shown by lightly incised lines. The nose is pinched, as in pre- historic ﬁgures, and round the neck is a series of bands or torques such as are also found on ﬁgures of the Chalcolithic Age. These, as well as a hip-girdle and cross-straps in front of the body, are shown by lightly incised lines. The hair, which falls down the back of the neck, is square-cut and indicated by crossed lines. Behind the head, in the middle of the hair, is a rosette, and three other rosettes on the top of the head. In the ears are rosette ear-rings. The idol is probably of prehistoric date, having found its way by chance into the later ruins of the Bhir Mound, but it is also possible that this and the four following ﬁgurines came from ritual tanks of the kind described below (nos. I 53—63). Cf. the ﬁgures in Pl. 136, w and no (nos. I 58, 159).I (Pl. 132, no. I.)",132-I,Bm,3,1920

Elephants Terra-cotta elephants are found in both the Bhir Mound and Sirkap. Some have riders, some not.

As a rule, the earlier specimens from the Bhir Mound are more ornamental than the later from Sirkap. No. 72, however, from the Bhir Mound is quite plain, and no. 73 from the same site has only a girth and neck ropes to relieve its plainness, but most of the Bhir Mound specimens are embellished with a variety of small patterned squares or triangles or circles or lozenges stamped on the surface of the head and trunk. One elephant only of this class comes from Sirkap, viz. no. 75, and in this case there is only one stamped device instead of several, and the workmanship has become noticeably cruder. Some effort towards decoration has been made in the case of the Sirkap elephant no. 76, but the ornament consists only of a row of incised circles to indicate the girth, and a group of similar circlets on the head to indicate perhaps the head—cloth. The few examples of these elephants which carry riders come exclusively from the Bhir Mound, and are easily recognisable from the peculiar way in which the legs and seats of the riders are ﬂattened against the body of the elephants. Evi- dently the toy-makers from TaXila had much greater diﬂiculty in giving the riders a natural seat on the backs of these great beasts than the sculptors of Siﬁchi had. Possibly they were not so much at home with the elephant as were their fellow craftsmen of Central India and Hindustan. It is evident, too, that in the pre—Greek period represented on the Bhir Mound these toy elephants were much greater favourites than later on, when the Maurya rule had been replaced by the Yavana. As regards technique, most of the elephants are solid throughout, but a few of the largest ones from the Bhir Mound (e.g. nos. 78 and 79), like some of the largest horses, have hollow bodies and legs. This is for the sake of lightness. Such speci— mens are not very well modelled nor are they embellished with stamped designs. With few exceptions, the clay is red and well-burnt but without any slip, though in one or two of the better examples a wash has been applied to the surface. Only rarely is the clay grey-black, e.g. in no. 76 and in the miniature elephants nos. 80 and 81. The tusks are of one piece with the rest of the beast, not inserted, as they sometimes are in other parts of India, into sockets. The eye is generally diamond—shaped and stamped, but sometimes lozenge-shaped. CH. 24] TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 455",P1.134-71.,Sk,6,

Like the largest elephants, only the largest horses have hollow bodies and legs, and these are very rare. The clay is usually red and well burnt, sometimes with a grey core, sometimes red throughout. The saddle-horse no. 83 is of buff- coloured clay with traces of a thin red paint. The horses on wheels come from the Bhir Mound only. Besides these there are horses with harness, some with saddles, some without; and one very small specimen with a rider. Of the saddled horses illustrated in P1. 13 5, one specimen (no. 83) comes from the Bhir Mound and one from the Sirkap (no. 87). In the former, the saddle, which rose high in front and rear, was kept in position by a girth-band passed over the top, with a breast—band in front and a crupper behind. The latter is a- crudely fashioned little toy, and all that can be made out of it is that the saddle was four- peaked, with two peaks in front and two behind, and that it was held with a crupper behind. Cf. also no. 86, a rather better specimen of the four-peaked saddle. As a rule, the toy horses from the Bhir Mound are, like the elephants, more ornamental but less truthfully modelled than those from Sirkap; but whereas the 58-2 Horses 456 TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [CH. 24 elephant was the more favourite toy in the Maurya period at Taxila, the horse was more fashionable under the Greeks, Sakas and Parthians. In the Bhir Mound examples, the head—stalls are composed, like the Indian head—stalls of this period in Hindustan and Central India, of vertical cheek-straps and face—strap with horizontal front- and nose—bands, and sometimes an extra strap between the front- and nose—bands. Thus, in these early examples, the straps making up the head—stall were either vertical or horizontal. In the later examples from Sirkap, on the other hand (e.g. nos. 88 and 89), there are usually cross-straps running obliquely from the middle of the face—strap to the ends of the bit. At the junction of the straps in both earlier and later types there is commonly a boss, medallion or rosette. For head—stalls at Siﬁchi, see Maisey, Sdﬁchi and its Remains, Pl. XV, ﬁgs. 14. and 15. In the true Indian harness, plumes were almost invariable, both for riding and driving horses. Even in the toys, plumes are very commonly shown, not only in the earlier specimens from the Bhir Mound but in the later ones from the Greek, Saka and Parthian settlements in Sirkap. Observe that in no. 82—a large hollow toy—there is a ﬂy-whisk of loose leather straps hanging from the middle of the front band. In this specimen the eye is formed of a small applied circlet with a hole in the middle. In no. 84 the eye is formed of a round pellet crossed by a straight incision. In the later examples from Sirkap the eyes are twice or thrice as large, and are generally worked up or incised in the body of the clay; in some cases, however, they are applied. Let it be added that the Sirkap heads usually have a transverse hole through the mouth for a strmg.",,Bm,3,1924

An interesting type of personal ornament, found chieﬂy in the Bhir Mound, takes the form of a round medallion or bulla of terra-cotta, usually convex on its outer side and decorated with reliefs. Some specimens are provided with one or two small holes for attachment, pierced either from back to front or transversely across the face. Other specimens have no holes at all. In the simpler ""kinds the decoration consists of rosettes or circular beaded mouldings; in the more elaborate ones the beaded circles are centred with human masks or ﬁgures in relief or with a geometric design. What purpose these medallions served is uncertain. Possibly they may have been in the nature of amulets, like the bullae which Roman boys wore as a protection against the fascination of the evil eye; or they may have been simple ornaments (possibly some were ear-rings) without any particular talismanic signiﬁcance. Whether they were of Indian or foreign origin is open to question, but it is noteworthy that the human masks are characteristically Greek, While the relief of the lion attacking a bull is certainly not Indian.

Cf. p. 284 supra. (P1. 136, 11.) From Sirkap there come also a number of moulds which appear to have been used by ancient coin-forgers, just as such moulds are used by present-day forgers. The moulds take the form of ﬂat circular tablets of terra-cotta, with the impress of half a d0zen or a dozen coins in each, the coins being those of the Saka kings, Maues and Azes II. The moulds themselves appear to date from the closing years of the Parthian rule at Taxila, when the kings whose coins are ﬁgured on them had long since passed away. It is well known, however, and there is abundant evidence at Taxila itself to show, that these and many other coins, some even older than the issues of Maues, continued in circulation throughout the Parthian period, and no doubt the forgers, whoever they were, found it safer to copy the older issues rather than to forge the current coins of the realm.

These tanks do not number more than ﬁfteen in all, inclusive of fragments, and out of this number four were found, as already stated,‘ alongside the base of the small stﬁpa in the Parthian palace of Sirkap, where they were still evidently occupying the places where they had originally been dedicated; a ﬁfth was lying loose in the debris near by, and two others were found in the court— yard of the stﬁpa in Block A. As there are grounds for believing that these two stﬁpas were Jaina rather than Buddhist structures, and as none of the tanks has been found at any of the innumerable Buddhist stﬁpas at Taxila, it is not unreason- able to surmise that they were particularly connected with Jaina ritual. Earliest type a. In the earliest form represented at Taxila the votive tank consists merely of a round bowl with a number of miniature saucer-shaped lamps round its rim. Three specimens only of this type have been found: two in the Bhir Mound, and one in the lowest stratum of Sirkap. They are assignable to the third and second centuries B.C. In the Bhir Mound examples the rim is not ﬂattened; in the Sirkap example it is.","136-p, 136-q, 136-1'",Sk,,

On one side of the tank is a small shrine with a primitive-looking idol of a goddess either inside or in front of it.

Generally the idol stands beside the steps about half an inch above the ﬂoor; but in one example (no. 160) the shrine itself is placed on the ﬂoor of the tank with the idol inside it. Usually the shrine is in the form of a rectangular chamber, shallow from front to back and with or without a pillar in the middle of the facade.

MM , m »<*\,W CH. 24] TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 465 A few other specimens of these votive tanks have also been recovered from among the ruins of Sirkap, for the most part in a fragmentary state; but as they are merely duplicates of the foregoing, it would be superﬂuous to describe them. The questions that we must now endeavour to answer are, ﬁrst, what was the signiﬁcance and purpose of these interesting tanks, and secondly, how came they to be dedicated at these stﬁpas, whether Jaina or Buddhist? One thing, clear before all else, is that they are intimately connected with the cult of the nude goddess whose shrine and miniature idol stand, in many of the specimens, on one side of the tank. Probably this was the Great Mother-goddess whose cult was ubiquitous in ancient India and went back to immemorial times. It was this same Mother— goddess, as I have elsewhere shown,I whose terra-cotta images are found at Mohenjo-daro and other sites of the Chalcolithic Age, who appears ﬁgured on the thin gold plate found by the late Dr Bloch in the heart of a prehistoric funeral tumulus at Lauriya Araraj,2 and who is carved in relief on the inner side of certain ringstones of Maurya date—themselves possessed of magic properties associated with fertilityﬁ Then, another obvious feature of these tanks is that they are symbolical of the four elements and of all creation: of earth, air, ﬁre and water, and of all the beings that live in them—the earth symbolised by the clay of which the tank is made, the air by the birds, the ﬁre by the lamps, and the water by the aquatic creatures within, as well as by the water itself with which the tank was partly ﬁlled. Such symbolism calls for no recondite explanation, for there is no reason for supposing that it implies anything more than that, in the eyes of the votary, the goddess was supreme over the four elements and all created things contained in them. That, at any rate, is an adequate explanation, beyond which it is hardly necessary to go. We should not forget, however, that tanks have a certain peculiar sanctity of their own in India, partly because they are the familiar adjuncts of countless shrines and temples throughout the length and breadth of the land, partly because of the all—important part they play in the ceremonial ablutions of the worshippers. An eX-voto, therefore, consisting of a miniature shrine with a tank by its side would be a very natural and appropriate form of offering. But why—and this is the second question we have to answer—should these ritual tanks which appertained to an essentially Hindu cult, have been dedicated at Jaina or—'—if there is any doubt about them being Jaina—at Buddhist stﬁpas? The answer is to be found in the contamination which has taken place in every religion known to us, and which in the ﬁrst century AD. was affecting Jainism as much as it was affecting Buddhism. However philosophic and abstract in their essence these two religious systems may originally have been, it was inevitable that they should take much of their subsequent colour from the primitive and long- established faiths of the people, and that, as they cast their nets wider and wider among the many nations of India and its varied classes of society, they should I See M.I.C. vol. I, pp. 49—52. 2 Cf. A.S.R. (1906—7), p. 124. 3 See ‘ Stone Objects’, ch. 25, nos. 129-32 infra. Connexion with cult of Mother- goddess Symbolism of the four elements Sanctity of tanks in India Fusion of older cuts with Buddhism and Jainism Connexion of ritual tanks with the dead           466 TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [CH. 24 absorb into themselves many beliefs and concrete cultural practices undreamt of by their founders. In the case of Buddhism it is well known how much current folklore went to the making of the jdtakas, and if we turn to the sculptures of Bharhut and Siﬁchi—our surest and safest guides to the character of popular Buddhism in the ﬁrst century B.C.—we ﬁnd evidence on every hand of the extent to which the Sakya faith had amalgamated with the cults and superstitions of an earlier age, and become blended with them into the newer Buddhism. Thus we see in these sculptures how Lakshmi, ancient goddess of prosperity and domestic happiness, had been transformed into Maya, the mother of the Blessed One; how the magic Tree of Life and Fortune still continued to shower its blessings on the Buddhists, as it had showered them from time immemorial on their ancestors; and how yakshas and yakshis, ndgas and ndgis played just as real and Vital a part in the new faith as they had done in the old. It can hardly surprise us, therefore, to ﬁnd these little shrines and tanks of the Mother-goddess dedicated by Jaina suppliants at the foot of their stﬁpas. They are only another illustration of the inevitable fusion that was taking place between the primitive cults of pre—Aryan India and a creed which was largely above the heads of the masses. The process is one which can still be seen going on in Burma, where images of the old indigenous Nats are still being set up as guardian genii round many of the Buddhist pagodas, as these small ﬁgures of the Mother-goddess were no doubt meant to protect the Taxila stﬁpas. It may be, too, that this form of votive offering had some special signiﬁcance in connexion with the dead; for the stﬁpa, be it remembered, was in origin a burial tumulus and there is no reason to suppose that its original character was ever lost sight of. I make this suggestion because small tanks of a somewhat similar kind to those we are discussing are still in use in Bengal in connexion with certain rites to Yama, the god of Death,’ known as Yama-pukur-bmta. The rites are performed by unmarried girls for four consecutive years and for a full month beginning with the last day of the month Aswin and ending with the last day of Kartik: that is, from the middle of October to the middle of November. The following is the manner of the rites. A tiny tank, about a cubit square with a channel on one side, is dug in the courtyard of the house, and on the eastern side of it are placed plants of rice, banana, turmeric, tulsi,I main,2 kalmi,3 and susm',4 all tied together in a bundle. Then a cowry, a betel nut and a piece of turmeric are placed at each of the four corners of the tank. Next, a number of small ﬁgures are made from the excavated earth, viz. a crocodile, an eel, a tortoise, a shark, sixteen dolls representing washer- men, ﬁshermen and others, and a number of crows, cranes, kites and other birds. Of these, the crocodile, shark, eel and tortoise are placed on the edges of the tank, the two latter near the channel, the birds stuck on little sticks are planted in the middle of the tank, and of the sixteen dolls four are set on each of the banks. Thereafter, an eﬂ'igy of Yama is made lying in his mother’s lap, and is placed on the eastern edge beside the bundle of plants; and lastly, lamps are lit at the corners of ‘ Ocimum sanctum. 2 Alocasz'a Indica. 3 Ipomaea aquatica. 4 Mam'lea quadrzfolia. ‘ t g 3 CH. 24] TERRA—GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 467 the tank. The girls then proceed to make offerings to Yama and his mother by casting ﬂowers into the tank and pouring water therein, while they recite certain mantras, bowing down and praying for long life and prosperity for their families and themselves. When the mantras and prayers are ﬁnished, two tales are told by the girls about the powers of the Yama-pukur-brata and the evils that come to those who interfere with the ritual ;I and on the last day of the ceremonies, at the end of the fourth year, the girls give food to Brahmans, and to a cowboy they give an umbrella, a piece of cloth, a pair of shoes, a stick and ten cowry shells. Here, then, in this Yama—pulsar of Bengal we have all the essential features of the votive tank at Taxila, viz. the square tank of water, the creatures that live in water, the birds of the air, and the lamps of ﬁre, representing in both cases the four elements and all created things over which Yama, no less than the Great Mother-goddess, rules. A curious analogy to these votive tanks of Taxila is also presented by a class of earthenware models found in Egyptian graves of the Middle Empire, two examples of which are illustrated in P1. 136, bb, cc. To Egyptologists they are commonly known as ‘ soul—houses ’, and the former of the two examples illustrated (no. I 36, bb) is doubtless a model of an Egyptian house intended for the soul of the departed.2 The other (cc) is more probably in the nature of an ‘ offerings—dish’, but, with its little lamp in one corner, it can hardly fail to remind us of the tank—shrines of Taxila, albeit the resemblance may be only a fortuitous one. A closer parallel to the latter is afforded by some votive models which were found a few years ago at Hephaestia in the Isle of Lemnos and described in the Illustrated London News3 by Dr Doro Lévi. These ex-votos (Pl. 136, aa), which date from the sixth century B.C., consist of a miniature shrine (usually three-chambered) of terra-cotta, with a shallow tank in front, the latter being rectangular or semicircular in plan; and in the tank are various aquatic animals—eels, tortoises and the like—just as there are in the Taxila tanks. Moreover, in the case of one of the specimens illustrated the resem— blance is increased by the presence of a ﬁgure seated on the edge of the tank in front of the shrine. That there is any immediate connexion between these tank- shrines from Hephaestia and those from Sirkap is, on the face of it, hardly probable, but it is by no means unlikely that both may go back to a common prototype which in the Chalcolithic Age may well have had a diffusion in the Near and Middle East as wide as the cult of the Great Mother-goddess herself. However this may be, there can be virtually no question that the votive tanks at Taxila were Indian in character. It is true that they occur very rarely in the Bhir Mound, and that such as have been found there are of a different type from those found in Sirkap, I For the brata and the tales told by the girls, see the appendix to this chapter, pp. 473—5. 1 These so-called ‘soul-houses’ were not known, so far as I am aware, in Roman Egypt. A large number of beautiful specimens were found by Petrie at Rifeh and are published in his Giza]: and Rifeh. They date from the period between the VIth and XIth Dynasties. In Saite times they are also known, but of a very rough form. 3 Illustrated London News (28 Feb. 1931), pp. 328—31. Cf. Arch. Anzeiger (I930), p. 14.6; }.H.S.

Against this inference, however, there are two un- answerable arguments. The ﬁrst is that some broken tank-shrines of the same kind were found by the writer as far east as Bhiga near Allahabad—in the heart of Hindustan, Where the Parthians never penetrated.I The second is that the idols in the tank-shrines were of a type familiar in India from prehistoric times and such as were still, in the ﬁrst century A.D., quite in keeping with popular ideas, but not such as foreign invaders from the West, whether Parthian, Scythian or Greek, are likely to have manufactured. We come now to a class of terra—cotta and clay ﬁgures which are exclusively . Buddhist in character and altogether more impressive than the preceding examples. In style, they are generally similar to the Buddhist stucco sculptures described in chapter 26, but thanks to the greater plasticity of clay as compared with stucco and to the ease with which it can be handled, many of these ﬁgures show a freedom in their modelling and a sensitiveness to form which was never quite attained in stucco work. With a few rare exceptions, all these ﬁgures belong to the Indo-Afghan School of the fourth to ﬁfth century A.D., and comprise, as we shall see, several pieces of surpassing merit. The smaller ﬁgures were usually of terra-cotta throughout, that is, of clay ﬁred in a kiln. Of the larger ﬁgures, some were made entirely of sun-dried clay; in others, the head was of terra-cotta, the rest of sun- dried clay. Dharmarajika I64. Dh. ’13—493; from building L.

181,,,, XXIV. Buddhist terra-cotta and clay ﬁgures (nos. 164-87),,"181. In. ’27—F 583. How the various ﬁgures described above—Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, lay-worshippers, monks and deeds—were grouped together on the walls of the stﬁpas or monasteries we have already seen well exempliﬁed in the stucco reliefs at both Mohra Moradu and Jauliaﬁ, but a still more instructive example is provided by a remarkable group at Jauliaﬁ, which was executed in clay and by a lucky chance converted into terra-cotta by a ﬁre which burnt down the monastery. This group occupied a large shallow niche (5 ft. 6 in. x 4 ft. 10-5 in.) in front of cell 29, protected from the weather by the broad veranda which ran round the four sides of the court. In the «centre stands the Buddha, now headless, evidently in the abhaya attitude. To his right is a male ﬁgure of medium size wearing a tunic which reaches to his knees, trousers with buttons for lacing, a clasped and jewelled belt and a pointed cap. Between this ﬁgure and the Buddha is a small female ﬁgure, clad in a long dress and ample shawl; and, to the Buddha’s left, a monk wearing a sarighdﬂ, with his right shoulder bare. Above, to the right and left of the Buddha’s head and shoulders, are two dews, standing on lotuses and looking down towards the Buddha. On the side walls of the niche were two large standing Bodhisattvas, but little of them, unfortunately, has survived. Of the ﬁgures on the back wall of the niche, the monk on the Buddha’s left is probably the abbot of the monastery, while the man wearing the conical cap and tunic is no doubt the donor of the group, and the little woman beside him, his wife. The dress and distinctive bearded face of the donor mark him clearly as a foreigner (mleccha) from the Persian side. Particularly noteworthy are his cap, laced-up trousers (or possibly leggings over the trousers) and the clasped belt which holds in his tunic round the hips. The last-mentioned was probably of gold or silver, either embossed or encrusted with gems. In true oriental fashion, the donor’s wife is represented as little more than half his size. Her dress, too, is of interest. It consists apparently of a long tunic like the Greek chitén, with a shawl (Indian sari; Greek himation) draped loosely over the left arm and shoulder and round the legs in front, leaving the tunic visible over the upper part of the body. Her ornaments consist of two bangles on each wrist, an armlet on the right arm, a heavy neck- lace, and a lighter girdle (mekhald) round her hips. Her cap appears to be provided with the characteristic Persian cheek-pieces or band which passes beneath the chin, and to be secured with cross straps fastened with a medallion in front and tied at the back of the neck. The dress worn by the celestial dew to the proper right of the Buddha is much the same as that Worn by the woman below, except that the under-tunic is so disposed as to leave the right shoulder bare and that the dew’s long wavy curls are unconﬁned by a cap. A feature of this dew that merits 60-2 Jauliaﬁ (nos. 181—6) Iandiil   472 TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [CH. 24 particular notice is the dreamy expression of the eyes, the lids of which are half-closed, as they almost invariably are in conventional images of the Buddha.

Later on, in the early medieval period, it evidently came to be regarded as a characteristic trait of the celestial devas who offered their worship and tribute to the Buddha.

We know now from these remains at Taxilaithat, whatever Hellenistic tradition may have lingered on into the ﬁfth century, the Indo-Afghan School was anything but a mimetic one. It was conservative to the extent that it perpetuated many of the orthodox forms ofBuddhist imagery, but it was essentially a living art, instinct with new energy and creative power, and it made most valuable contributions to the later art of Hindustan and Central India. The time when it may truly he said that art at Taxila was mainly an imitation of Hellenistic art was during the Parthian period, and we have only to turn to the stucco ﬁgures of that period from Sirkap to understand how degenerate Hellenistic art could become in the hands of Indian imitators who had no creative genius of their own. Three centuries later conditions had entirely changed: the sculptors of the Indo~Afghéin School were still making use here and there of Hellenistic motifs and ideas, but only to assimilate them into the body of their own art, which in its own way was just as original, forceful and independent as the Gupta art of Hindu— stan and more so than contemporary Byzantine art in the West. Some general remarks on the terrancottas from the Bhir Mound will be found in vol. I at pp. 104mg, 108, III; and on those from Sirkap at pp. 127—8, 133, 203, 208-9.

These, as well as a hip-girdle and cross-straps in front of the body, are shown by lightly incised lines.

Behind the head, in the middle of the hair, is a rosette, and three other rosettes on the top of the head. In the ears are rosette ear—rings. The idol is probably of prehistoric date, having found its way by chance into the later ruins of the Bhir Mound, but it is also possible that this and the four following ﬁgurines came from ritual tanks of the kind described below (nos. 153—63).
