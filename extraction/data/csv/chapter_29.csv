Of Jihonika, the Satrap of Chukhsa, son of (Manigula, brother) of the Great King.’ Cf. p. 156 (I7) supra. The form is typical of the ﬁrst century B.C. to ﬁrst century A.D. work. Cf.

The trumpet base appears to be a local peculiarity (cf. the bowls nos. 8, a—c infra), but it occurs in Sasanian metalwork, probably derived from Parthian and perhaps ultimately from Achaemenid prototypes. Cf. Sarre, Kunst des alteu Persien, Pls. CXX, CXXVIII, CXXXV, etc. The genitive jihouikasa is probably to be understood in an absolute sense, as implying that the date was ‘ during the reign of’ Jihonika (Zeionises), but it may be possessive, implying, as in nos. 7, 10, etc., that the askos was the property of Jihonika.

(‘Copper and Bronze’, nos. 272, 273, P1. 174; ‘Pottery’, no. 91, P1. 124.) The shape may have been affected by the Hellenistic kantharos, though without the handles; but it seems rather to have been derived from the prehistoric earthenware beaker with pointed bottom. In all these metal goblets the bases are much too small for the size and weight of the vessel. Seemingly, the beverage was meant to be drunk at one draught.

Dra 2.0 2. = ‘Of As’pavarma, the strategos. 11 staters, 2 drachms, 2 obols.’ For the shape, cf. ‘Pottery’, no. 107. As’pavarma, son of Indravarma, was ‘strategos’ during the reigns of Azes II and Gondophares. He was succeeded by his ‘nephew’ Sasas, but not in the ofﬁce of strategos. The title strategos was inherited by the Sakas and Parthians from the Seleucid Empire. What precisely the title implied is uncertain. In the Cambridge History of India it is translated ‘commander-in—chief’; by others it has been interpreted as the equivalent of satrap. That it implied something more than ‘commander-in-chief’ seems probable from the fact that Aspavarma struck coins in his own name as strategos. On the other hand, it is evident that there was a distinction at TaXila between kshatrapa and strategos. Cf. ch. 2, p. 62 supra.

Behind his head passes the curved staff (thyrsos), with a bell suspended at its end. The front of the stand is adorned with a conventional palmette, and a rosette beneath; behind, is a curved ‘thumb—piece’ which enabled the head to be set in a slanting position on the table.
