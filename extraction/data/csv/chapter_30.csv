Gold ear-pendant in two pieces, the upper attached to the lower by means of a hook, which passes through a hollow cylinder in the latter. Height 4-37 in. The upper portion is built up on a square framework of ﬂat gold wire, subdivided into four small squares. At the back 79‘2 Disk-and- pendant and bar-and- pendant types Leech—and- pendant type 624 GOLD AND SILVER JEWELLERY [CH. 30 of this is a somewhat broader band of gold ending in two hooks which project beyond the framework on either side; at the point of projection the base of each hook is enriched with a small circlet edged with granules. The ornament on this framework consists of a quatrefoil central ﬂower, with sprays of three small leaves springing from the tips of its four obcordate petals, and rosettes alternating with them at the corners. Both rosettes and leaves were inlaid with turquoise paste. The central ﬂower is ﬁnely granulated and further enriched with a corona of ﬁve obcordate petals also inlaid With turquoise, on which a gold cupid is reposing. The lower piece consists of an amphora in the centre, and on either side of it an infant Eros riding on a winged sea-lion, from which hang four plaited chains ending in a pearl and leaf terminal, with a cluster of granules at the bottom of each leaf. The amphora is of beaded gold ﬁligrain, with panels of turquoise paste between. It is set upon a three-stepped base, from which hang ﬁve gold drops with a cluster of four tiny granules on each. The granules are of solid metal; the larger drops hollow. The cylinder on the top of the amphora has a beaded rim of gold granules. The winged cupids and sea-monsters appear to have been cast in a mould, and afterwards chased with a graving tool. The hair of the cupids, which falls on the shoulders in a natural row of ringlets, is very carefully worked. The wings and ears of the monsters and the wings of their riders both front and back are inlaid with turquoise, some pieces of which are missing. First century AD.

Between the points of the petals are globules of gold, and in the centre a beaded circlet, once ﬁlled with turquoise paste. The outer petals of the ﬂower are embossed with imitation granules; the inner petals are plain.

Amulets and pendants have been classed together in this section because it is impossible in some cases to be sure whether a particular pendant has an amuletic value or not. That the claw or tooth pendant (no. 80), the swastikas (no. 85), the pipal leaves (no. 88), the bell (no. 89), and the clubs (nos. 91, 92), were employed as amulets is beyond question, and it is equally certain that nos. 82—4 were intended to hold relics or charms of some sort. But it is not so clear whether nos. 86, 87, 90, 93, 94 and 95 were designed as amulets or merely as ornaments.

She wears armlets, bracelets and a crossed breast—band. Her hair is gathered in a knot on the crown of her head, with curls falling in front over her ears. Behind her shoulders appear two wings, roughly depicted. The relief, which is of thin plate-gold, was probably fashioned with the help of a stone or metal matrix, and afterwards ﬁnished with punches and graving tools. The back was made in a separate piece and soldered to it. Attached to the latter are three small rings, two behind the wings and one behind the feet.

Three circlets of gold with double rows of beading support each of the three component parts. A particular interest attaches to this hair—pin because of the combination of Indian and Greek motifs, the crescent (Gr. uﬁvw'Kos) being characteristically Greek (e.g. B.M. Cat. of jewellery, nos. 2360—5, 2449—62, etc.) and the triratna just as characteristically Indian. A similar pin but without the crescent is ﬁgured on the west gateway of Saﬁchi fastening the knotted thong over the scabbard of a broad sword (Marshall and Foucher, The Monuments of Sanchz‘, Pl. LXVI, a). The triratna, an age-old device in India, was specially adopted by the Buddhists as a symbol of the Buddhist Trinity, and is ﬁgured in great profusion on the early Buddhist monuments at Saﬁchi, Bharhat and elsewhere.

Four hollow double-ringed anklets of silver. Diam. 6-25 in. The anklets are open in front and provided with a movable socket to cover the aperture. The upper ring is ﬂuted and further decorated on the upper surface with three lotus cones or bosses. Below each boss, connecting the two rings together, is a lotus medallion centred with a human bust in relief. The movable sockets are enriched with a variety of repoussé designs, Viz. on the upper sockets, a band of full and half-lotus rosettes in diamond-shaped panels, between borders of quatrefoil ﬂowers and cable edgings; on lower socket, band of tortoises following one another, with leaves between, and sinuous vine borders. Ornamentation of this kind, characterised by bands of lotus rosettes, sinuous vine borders, full—blown lotuses centred with human busts, etc., can readily be paralleled among the sculptures of Sanchi and Bharhat and other reliefs of the Early Indian School. Some of the motifs (e.g. the vine), which were adopted by that School, were doubtless of Greek or Western Asiatic origin, having been introduced by the Bactrian Greeks or still earlier, under Maurya rule, but the character of the art is indisputably Indian.
