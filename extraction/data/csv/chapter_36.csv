She is clad in a classical dress consisting of a long tunic and mantle; in her left hand she holds a ‘horn of plenty’ (cornucopia); her right hand is wrapped in her mantle. On her head is a low poles. Over the stool is a coverlet with chequered pattern. The type is a common one throughout the Graeco-Roman world and has been identiﬁed variously as Demeter, Tyche, Fortuna, Bona Dea, etc. As early as the middle of the sixth century B.C., Boupalos of Chios executed a statue of Tyche for Smyrna, which, I See, however, the descriptions of nos.

3,58,116,D,,"58,116","3. Standing female ﬁgure of chloritised mica schist, in the round. Height 9 in. The ﬁgure is naked save for a shawl or sari, which falls over the left arm and below the hips. The left hand holds the hem of the surf; in the right hand, which is raised to the breasts, is a lotus. Her ornaments consist of a hip girdle (mekhald) with square clasp in front and three rows of beads; a breast—chain, crossed both front and back; bracelets; armlets; and a narrow taenia across the forehead. The hair is taken back from the forehead and falls in a long plait down the back, with a few curls on the two shoulders. On the crown of the head, at the back, is an ornamental medallion. The type appears to be derived from a Greek Aphrodite type, but is much Indianised. It may have been intended to represent an Indian yakshz‘ or fairy; but it seems more likely to be the goddess holding a lotus in her hand who is portrayed on certain autonomous coins of TaXila, and may represent either the Tyche of the city, or, more probably, Maya. (B.M. Cat. Am. Ind. Coins, Pl. XXXII, 5, 6). In the Gandhara School, to which this sculpture belongs, ﬁgures in the round are very rare and for the most part earlier than the usual alto rilievos. (Cf. Mathura Museum, F42.) This statuette dates from the Saka—Parthian period and is probably to be referred to the early part of the ﬁrst century A.D.

4,18,93,A,,"18,93","4. Standing female ﬁgure in the round of chloritised mica schist, probably dating from the ﬁrst century B.C. Height 725 in. The pose is rigidly frontal, with feet front, legs together, and hands on hips. Save for ornaments consisting of anklets, girdle, crossed breast-chain, armlets and bangles, the ﬁgure is nude. The hair, which is treated like a wig in front, is taken back from the forehead and falls in a long plait down the back, with a few curls on each shoulder. On the top of the head is a low polos. Beneath the small base is a projecting tenon, evidently intended to ﬁt into a socket-hole. In ancient times the statuette was broken into two at the knees, and, in order to repair it, two small holes were drilled between the legs, one above and one below the fracture. The stiff frontal pose and the poles on the head suggest a Caryatid, but the ﬁgure is so small that it can hardly have served that purpose. Possibly the sculptor was endeavouring to portray an archaic type, such as that of the ‘Mother or Earth goddess’, which was still being perpetuated at TaXila as late as the ﬁrst century A.D., but this is quite problematical.

5,63,100,D,,"63,100","5. Standing female ﬁgure in the round of pale grey micaceous slate. Height 4-12 in. The ﬁgure, which may be that of a donor belonging to a group, wears a sleeved tunic reaching to the feet, and a cloak which appears to be held in place by shoulder-straps passing in front of the shoulders and attached, perhaps, to the belt. The hands are raised in front of the waist and support a tray(?) full of ﬂowers or other offerings. The ornaments worn comprise anklets, bangles and girdle (mekhald). The head, which was made in a separate piece and joined to the body by a tenon and socket, is missing, but two plaits of hair are shown falling over the cloak at the back. Probable date, early ﬁrst century A.D. Cf. p. 191 supra; A.S.R. (1928), P1. XIX, 2. Sk. ’28—I,163; Block D’; sq. 63-100’; stratum II. (Pl. 212, no. 5, a, b.)",212-5-a-b,Sk,2,1928

The right hand is raised in front of the breast with the ﬁngers in what is known as the chin-mudra or jndﬁa—mudrd, denoting meditation, knowledge and purity. The left hand rests on the hip. The head and feet are missing. Although the ﬁgure is ostensibly in the round, the front is ﬂattened as in a relief and the back is not modelled. As the sculpture was found at the Dharmarajika Stﬁpa, there can be no doubt that it is Buddhist, and we may surmise that it represents the Bodhisattva at a period when his types had not yet been ﬁxed. Like nos. 7 and I 5, it is the work of a local sculptor of Taxila. Date, early part of the ﬁrst century A.D. or perhaps the latter part of the preceding century. See p. 694 supra.

7,,,,,,"7. Standing male ﬁgure of grey Taraki sandstone in the same massive style as the preceding but perhaps a little earlier. Height 26-25 in. The ﬁgure wears a tunic tied by a cord at the waist and reaching to the knees, long shawl or himation, high boots and necklace(?). The high boots suggest that it may represent Sﬁrya, the Sun—god, whose temple is said by Philostratus (Life of Apollom'us, II, 24) to have stood in the city of Sirkap, where the statue was found. Like no. 6, the statue, although free-standing, is treated as much like an alto rilievo as a ﬁgure in the round. The right forearm, which was attached by means of a tenon and socket, is missing, and the head is defaced. The hair is arranged in the same wig-like fashion as on no. 4 and other ﬁgures of the early Gandhara School. The peculiar treatment of the drapery, which falls in loose folds round the shoulder and arms and stands out on either side of the hips, recalls that on certain coins of Azes I. (BM. Cat. Pl.

The ﬁgure wears bangles, necklaces and shawl, which is drawn across the back and through both arms, leaving the front of the body bare. On the head is a broad—tasselled bandeau. The feet and ankles are missing. Observe the rough heavy character of the modelling and the careless workmanship; also the formal treatment of the folds of the shawl, as in other ﬁgures of this period. Such brackets as this one and nos. 11, 12 and 16—21 were commonly used to adorn the domes of stﬁpas near their base. (Foucher, A.G—B.G. I, p. 59, ﬁg. 12.) Early Gandhara School.

On the back and tenon of the bracket is a Kharosh- thi inscription: Savatrateua m'yatito vihare matapitu puyae Devadato = ‘Presented by Sarvatrata in the Vihara, in honour of his mother and father, Devadatta’.

The ﬁgure appears to be wearing a long chitén of ﬁne texture, which falls in graceful folds to the feet, leaving the left leg bare. The top of it is seemingly folded over like a Doric chitén and reaches as far as the hips. At the waist it is conﬁned by a twisted band. The style is more distinctly classical than in the generality of Gandhara sculptures and it may have been inspired by a Greek ﬁgure of Nike, but its Indian origin is betrayed by the muscular left leg and the heavy anklet. The statue is not worked at the back. Pieces of gold—leaf with which the stone was once covered are preserved under a later layer of lime plaster. Of pale grey schist. Height I 5 in.

Of no. 90, b the right end is broken, and of the drawing of water by Syama we see nothing, the action opening with the king of Benares in the fatal act of discharging his arrow to the left. He stands facing left, his back to the spectator, his attendant, behind him, holding a large quiver full of arrows. Rocks and sparse vegetation indicate the wildness of the region, and a wild animal’s head is seen at the mouth of a cave below. The boy Syama is shown with the arrow transﬁxing his breast on the extreme right of no. 90, a.

The king raises his right hand in the chin-mudrd (cf. no. 6 supra and P1. 212, no. 6). He is then seen leading to their son’s body the aged couple, whose blind helplessness is very cleverly depicted. From the right, a haloed deity (Indra) comes ﬂying through the air; in his raised right hand is a ﬂask of ambrosia which, with a baptismal gesture, he is pouring on Syama’s head, and the boy is shown with uplifted hands already half-restored to life.

A curious feature is that, although the bases are shown, the circular shafts are absent and evidently never existed, as one base does not lie vertically below its capital. Between the two arches, its ﬂoor level with their capitals, runs a balcony, above the balustrade of which are seen the busts of two ﬁgures to the right, one of them defaced. Below the gallery, on a draped couch, its legs carved in the semblance of a horned animal aﬁronté, lies the sleeping Maya, lying on her left side, her head on a pillow, her left hand under her head and her right resting on the near edge of the couch. Above her right side and in front of the balcony are traces of the circular disk on which was the Elephant of the Conception, but this and the left side of the balcony are now broken away. Under the balcony and at Maya’s head stands a female attendant; at her feet is a defaced guardswoman, armed with a spear. Under the arch to the right and with her back to the spectator another attendant stands holding a water—pot in her right hand, her upraised left hand resting on the bell capital of the pillar. In the corresponding arch to the left stands an attendant, facing, with legs crossed at the ankles; all above the waist is defaced. A small footstool is in front of the couch.

On a draped throne, in front of which is a footstool, sits the haloed Bodhisattva with his right hand upraised in the abhaya-mudrd; the left hand in the lap holds a ﬂask. His robe is that of a Buddha. No jewels are worn and the hair is dressed above in a small double loop. Over the throne is a baldachin covered by a canopy with garland-like fringe and supported by columns of unusual form. These, for about two-thirds of their height, are of slender, tapering Indo-Corinthian type with acanthus capitals, their bases showing a lion aﬂronte’. Above the acanthus capitals the columns are continued as thinner, tapering, circular shafts up to the canopy. On each capital and with one arm round the thin shaft is a little naked yaksha, leaning inwards; the one to the left holds up a defaced object in his right hand. On either side of the Bodhisattva a haloed deity is seated in European fashion with face turned towards him. Indra, to the left of the Bodhisattva, raises up his right hand as if in argument; Brahma, CH. 36] STONE SCULPTURES 713 on the other side, clasps his hands in adoration or entreaty. Behind Brahma are two standing ﬁgures, one a haloed deity, the other defaced; and behind Indra is ahigh-caste personage, whose hands, again, are clasped in front of the body.

His head is turned towards the now missing Buddha, whilst his feet rest on the back of a prone male. In front of his waist he holds a short sword, his left hand on the scabbard, his right grasping the hilt, as if about to draw it.

Running round the outer edge of the frame is a saw—tooth moulding, and round the inner edge a beading. The incident represented in this panel is the descent of the Buddha at Sankas’ya from the Traya— strims’a heaven. In the centre the Buddha stands, facing, right hand upraised in abhaya- mudru'. On his right are Indra and an attendant with hands clasped in adoration, and behind them, in the upper background, Vajrapani. On the Buddha’s left are Brahma and an attendant, both with ﬂowing locks in similar attitudes of adoration, and behind them one of Brahma’s entourage. Of the triple ladder of the descent there is no indication. It may be noted that the texts and both Fa Hien and Hsiian Tsang state that Indra was on the left side of the Buddha, but his characteristic head-dress (cf. nos. 147—50 infra) leaves no doubt as to his identiﬁcation here on the Buddha’s right. Between this panel and the central one is a frieze with saw-tooth mouldings on the lower and upper edges, and between them four small panels separated by Indo—Corinthian pilasters; in each panel is a ﬁve-petalled ﬂower. (1)) The centre panel is rectangular with a half—ogee wing at either end. In the rectangular space is portrayed the ‘Presentation of the four bowls’, with the haloed Buddha seated 716 STONE SCULPTURES [CH. 36 in abhaya-mudrd on a grass-strewn throne. Two of the Lokapalas stand on either side, each holding an alms-bowl. Under each of the half-arches a worshipper kneels on one knee, facing inwards With hands elapsed in adoration. Between this scene and the lowest panel is an acanthus frieze above a ﬂat bead-and-reel moulding. (c) In the bottom panel is shown the ‘Entreaty to Preach’, Adhyeshaua. In the centre, the haloed Buddha, face now lost, is seated in abhaya-mudrd under a tree on a grass-strewn throne, the front of which is ornamented by a diamond pattern with a boss in the centre of each diamond. On the right of the Buddha is a haloed deity, presumably Indra, though the head—dress is not so characteristic as it usually is; the corresponding position on the other side of the Buddha shows two headless ﬁgures intended for Brahma and an attendant.

Outside the cave, on his left, stands Indra with halo and his usual high head-dress (cf. nos. 147—50 infra). His clasped hands touch the cave-wall. A unique feature is the presence, on the other side of the cave, of Brahma, haloed and in a similar attitude of adoration. Instead of the teeming life of the jungle the only animals are two wild boars in front of and below the mouth of the cave. Above the balustrade are four ﬁgures; the two on the sides are diving headlong, like Wingless angels, towards the middle of the balustrade, where from their cupped hands they rain down large, four-petalled blossoms which fall in front of the balustrade and on the top of the cave. In the background and between these two spirited and unique ﬁgures are two haloed devas about to drop similar ﬂowers over the balustrade. Apropos of these Wingless angels, M.

The wheel rests on the three points of a triratna, supported by a dwarf Indo-Corinthian pillar. Flanking the throne are two deer couchant regardant. An unusual feature is the presence, on the left of the Buddha, of Indra, haloed but now defaced, while Brahma, likewise haloed and in the guise of a Brahman novice, occupies the corresponding position on the Buddha’s right. On Brahma’s right is a bearded Vajrapani, with ﬂy—whisk (caurz') in right hand and vajra in left. In the left foreground two monks are seated on low, circular, grass-strewn seats.

The Buddha’s right hand is raised in abhaya-mudrd, his left rests in his lap, the ﬁrst two ﬁngers pointing downwards. On the Buddha’s left are four standing females, two younger ones in the upper background, two elder ones in the foreground. By the Buddha’s right shoulder stands a fully clothed and bearded Vajrapani, the end of his heavy wjra in his right hand. Below him is a middle—aged woman with two little girls, the taller standing by the edge of the throne, the smaller in front of it, her head level with the cushion. The skilful characterisation of the varying ages of the women is exceptional, and their coiffures exhibit great variety. The two younger women wear Chaplets, but in the case of the older women these are replaced by light coverings, falling like veils behind the shoulders. All the women wear ear—rings, collars, necklaces, bracelets and, where the feet are shown, anklets, except the very aged female on the right who wears only bracelets. The attitudes of the women are varied; three carry offerings in baskets, another has a bunch of blossoms in her right hand and one young female and the two children clasp their hands in adoration.

Below Paﬁcika are traces of ﬁve standing ﬁgures; those corresponding to them on the left of the cave are now only faintly discernible, but, judging from replicas of this scene, the one nearest the cave may have been Indra’s musician, Paﬁcasikha. Behind him are the six hoods of a Naga Snake—king, and a little higher up is a small ﬁgure, seated in meditation.

Under a mango tree the haloed Buddha is seated on a grass-strewn throne, the front embellished by a diamond trellis, with a four-leaved ﬂower in each diamond, the points of the leaves in the angles. The left hand of the Buddha, now lost, lay in his lap; his right is resting, palm upward, by his knee. On the left of the Buddha is king Prasenajit on a low, draped seat, his hands, now defaced, clasped in adoration. Behind him are traces of a standing ﬁgure. On the Buddha’s right are two naked tirtharikaras, the nearer, now headless, seated like the king in European fashion on a circular rattan stool, both hands resting on his left knee. His disciple, bald-headed and exceedingly ill—featured, stands behind him with right arm bent until the hand rests on the shoulder. The seated, headless tirthaﬁkara is apparently Purina Kasyapa. In the background, on the Buddha’s right, is Vajrapani, with vajra in his left hand and his right arm wrapped in his robe, the hand alone protruding from the neck of the garment. The corresponding position on the Buddha’s left is occupied by a standing, adoring ﬁgure, without halo—possibly one of king Prasenajit’s followers. The scene seems to illustrate very closely a phrase in the fataka: ‘The Master, having performed the yamaka—pdtihdriya and having realised the readiness of many people to believe, descended and sat on his Buddha throne and taught the law.’ The only difﬁculty is that the hands are not in the teaching attitude according to the Gandhara School.

On his right and left are female ﬁgures dancing to the music of the drum and ﬁfe, the former played by a female squatting in the foreground on the left of the panel, the ﬁfe by another female in the foreground on the right.

On the uppermost ledge, which is cushioned, are two ﬁgures seated in European fashion, behind and between whom stands an attendant with cauri. The ﬁgure to the left is defaced, that to right has the features also defaced, but the head is wrapped in his scarf like a man of inferior caste. Cf. nos. I 14—1 5 supra and A.G-B.G. ﬁgs. 250, 333. With upraised right hand he seems to argue with or entreat the ﬁgure to the left. On the lowest ledge a kneeling ﬁgure, with hands clasped in supplication, faces a male standing ﬁgure, much mutilated but with bangle on left wrist. To the left, with his back to the standing ﬁgure, is another defaced, kneeling person. Traces of a seat with turned legs are seen on the extreme left of a midway ledge.

Right of this is the head of a ﬁgure holding handle of dagger or broken sword and above this is an elephant’s head with upraised trunk, and behind that, again, another defaced animal—possibly a bull. In the upper background is a fully clothed, haloed but mutilated ﬁgure, right hand to chest, left holding a bag or purse(?). The animals and armed ﬁgure are suggestive of ‘Mara’s attack’, but the haloed ﬁgure in the background is unusual. Height 13-5 in. Dh. ’13—472; between L and D3; 2 ft. below surface.
