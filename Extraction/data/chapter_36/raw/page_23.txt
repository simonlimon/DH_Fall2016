CH. 36] STONE SCULPTURES 721

ch. 34, no. 24. Of phyllite. Height 8-9 in. Cf. p. 330 supra; A.S.R. (1930—4), P1. XCIV, d.
Kn. ’31—572; front of A15; 2 ft. below surface. (Pl. 222, no. 134.)

I3 5. Mutilated relief showing a line of ﬁve anchorites——the one on the right being headless.
All have long, twisted locks falling on either side of the head. Two are young and clean—shaven,
one is bearded, another has a moustache. The one on the left holds a ﬂask in his left hand. Two
of the older men have spotted deer-skins over the left shoulder. All have the right hand upraised
in front of the body, the centre one placing it on the right shoulder, like the tirthaukara in
no. 130 supra. They watch with seeming wonderI the progress of another young anchorite,
borne along, suspended head downwards, on a long pole carried on the shoulders of two com-
panions. The pole-carrier on the right wears a short skirt; the one on the left is defaced. The
suspended ﬁgure grasps the pole with his two hands, with his knees around the pole and the feet
extended upwards. There are traces of another ﬁgure behind the pole-carrier on the right. Tenon
on upper edge. A unique relief. Of micaceous schist. Height 13-25 in. Cf. pp. 184, 693—4 supra;
A.S.R. (1927), P1. XIX, 2. Sk. ’27—82; Block E’; sq. 75-93’; stratum I. (Pl. 222, no. 135.)

I36. Fragment of relief showing a rocky landscape. On the left, on a rocky ledge, stands a
slim youthful ﬁgure clad in a dhotz', the body bent backwards from the hips, the hands holding
up, with obvious effort, a large and seemingly heavy, circular, defaced and indeﬁnable object
which another ﬁgure, on a higher ledge to the right, seems either to push forward or to sustain
in position with his outstretched arms. The tense attitude and the contracted muscles of the
lower ﬁgure are admirably rendered. In the foreground, to the right and left, are traces of two
ﬁgures, the former apparently haloed. On the upper edge are traces of a frieze consisting of
a ﬂat reel—and—bead moulding above a scroll of vine-leaf ornament. Of phyllite. Height 22' 5 in.
Dh. ’14—C451. (Pl. 222, no. 136.)

I37. Fragment from extreme left of a relief showing a now headless ﬁgure in the abandon—
ment of grief (1"). He kneels on his left knee, his right leg ﬂexed, with his foot touching the left
knee, toes on the ground and body supported by the edge of the panel. The attitude is suggestive
of Vajrapani in Parinirvana scenes such as A.G-B.G. ﬁgs. 279—80, but the loss of both hands
robs this attribution of certainty, while doubt is also engendered by what is evidently the remains
of a necklace. Of phyllite. Height 8.25 in. Dh. ’12~335; I2; 3 ft. 8 in. below surface. Cf.
p. 245 supra.

138. Fragment of a relief showing the cremation of the Buddha and also half of the oil
receptacle, taila-drom', which formed the coﬂin. This stands on a stone pedestal with a saw-
tooth moulding on the upper and lower edges. Tongues of ﬂame lick the base of the taila-drozu'
and ﬁercer ﬂames arise from the surface. Two of the riveted plates joining the two pieces of the
coﬂin are clearly marked. Cf. A.G-B.G. ﬁgs. 285~7. Of phyllite. Height 837 in. Dh. ’14—959;
chapel D12; on top of wall. Cf. p. 249 supra. (Pl. 222, no. 138.)

139. Head and chest of a wild, coarse-featured ﬁgure, with short hair and large staring
eyes, bearing a load on his shoulders. The attitude is reminiscent of Greek ﬁgures carrying an
animal by the legs. Cf. A.G-B.G. ﬁg. 324. Of phyllite. Height 5-87 in. Dh. ’12—778; between
L and D 3; 5 ft. 6 in. below surface. Cf. p. 251 supra.

140. Fragment from the left side of a relief. The stone is much damaged but traces of the
haloed head and surmounting royal parasol of the Bodhisattva still remain, as well as one of his
long, impearled ear-rings. Behind his right shoulder is a youthful curly-haired Vajrapani,
grasping the middle of his 'zJajra in his right hand. Vajrapani is fully clothed and has a large
circular brooch at the neck of his robe in front. Of phyllite. Height 13- 5 in. Cf. p. 249 supra;
A.S.R. (1914), P1. IX, c. Dh. ’14—804; B17; 5 ft. 6 in. below surface.

141. Relief depicting the haloed Buddha seated, under a pipal(?) tree, on a draped and
cushioned throne, his right hand in abhaya-mudra‘, his left grasping the edge of his robe in his
lap. On his left are two personages of high rank, the nearer with ﬂexed right hand upraised in

I It is to be noted, however, that round, staring eyes are a characteristic feature of the early period of
Gandhara sculpture to which this relief belongs. Vide no. I 3 supra.
