ends they face inwards. In the second arch from the left the Buddha, haloed, is seated on a
grass—strewn throne, in meditation. In the arches to left and right standing male personages,
of high caste, turn towards him, the one to the left as though about to scatter ﬂowers, the
other to the right with hands joined in adoration, and the end ﬁgure with open hand held near the
shoulder, as if saluting. Length 22 in. Kn. ’32—149; H6; I ft- below surface. Cf- p. 341 supra.

77. Fragment of phyllite frieze showing two ogee arches, springing side by side from dwarf
pseudo-Corinthian pilasters, the shafts of which are relieved with a long, narrow, incised,
panel. The arches are simpler than those in no. 76 supra, having no end volutes and
showing no beam-ends, but they have the same saw-tooth moulding, and parakeets are seated
on the arch haunches facing inwards. Under the right arch stands a haloed Buddha, facing,
in abhaya-mudra. Under the other arch stands a female with left arm (defaced) raised level
with the shoulder and face turned half-right towards the Buddha. She wears a long tunic
reaching to the ankles and over it a himation draped over her left shoulder and leaving her right
shoulder and breasts free. Her hair is dressed high, and her ornaments comprise ear-rings,
necklace and heavy anklets. On the left a curved bead-and-reel moulding indicates some
variation in this part of the relief which is now broken. Length 10-8 in. Kn. ’3I~IOI; square
chamber, AI; 2 ft. below surface. Cf. pp. 328—9 supra. (Pl. 216, no. 77.)

vine scroll of great beauty (cf. nos. 51—3, 57), and below it three segmental arches with dental
mouldings springing from dwarf pseudo-Corinthian pilasters (cf. nos. 76, 77). In the
triangular spaces between the adjacent arches is a bird, facing with outspread wings, and under
each arch the bust of a clothed male ﬁgure, facing. The centre one has long hair, parted in the
middle, and hands raised level with the breast. The ﬁgure to the left is in a similar attitude but
wears an elaborate turban. The features of the right ﬁgure are defaced. Material and style
indicate an early date for the fragment. Length 6' 5 in. Dh. ’12—1,o42; between D3 and L;
