728 STONE SCULPTURES [CH. 36

obliterated. The central ﬁgure, of superior caste, wears a skirt and shawl, long necklace and
bracelet. His right hand is raised to the shoulder as in salutation, left hand by his side. T 0 his
left is a smaller, youthful personage, facing right and with right hand raised to shoulder.
Between the two is a now broken, pole-like object, possibly the stem of a tree. Height 7-7 in.
Kn. ’3 1—158; octagonal chamber, AI; 3 ft. below surface. Cf. pp. 378—9 supra.

194. Fragment of relief in two pieces. On upper edge are remains of a narrow frieze,
adorned with three undulating stems and four-petalled roses in the loops. In the centre, under
a canopy of conventional lotus leaves, are traces of a haloed, seated Bodhisattva(?) ﬁgure. On
his right and left are female ﬁgures dancing to the music of the drum and ﬁfe, the former
played by a female squatting in the foreground on the left of the panel, the ﬁfe by another
female in the foreground on the right. Despite the foliage, this appears to be a representation
of the ‘Life in the Palace’. Of micaceous schist. Height 10-5 in. Dh. ’13—684; West of D4;
I ft. 6 in. below surface.

195. Fragment of relief of unusual character, showing the ﬁgures on different planes,
marked by narrow, recessed ledges. On the uppermost ledge, which is cushioned, are two
ﬁgures seated in European fashion, behind and between whom stands an attendant with cauri.
The ﬁgure to the left is defaced, that to right has the features also defaced, but the head is
wrapped in his scarf like a man of inferior caste. Cf. nos. I 14—1 5 supra and A.G-B.G. ﬁgs. 250,
333. With upraised right hand he seems to argue with or entreat the ﬁgure to the left. On the
lowest ledge a kneeling ﬁgure, with hands clasped in supplication, faces a male standing ﬁgure,
much mutilated but with bangle on left wrist. To the left, with his back to the standing ﬁgure,
is another defaced, kneeling person. Traces of a seat with turned legs are seen on the extreme
left of a midway ledge. A unique and unidentiﬁed relief. Of phyllite. Height 20 in. Cf.
p. 249 supra; A.S.R. (1914), P1. IX, a’. Dh. ’14—803; B17; 5 ft. 6 in. below surface.

196. Fragment from right edge of relief depicting ‘Mara’s attack’. Mara, wearing only a
dhotr', elaborate turban, ear-rings and necklace, turns half-left in an attitude of deﬁance towards
the missing Buddha. He is supported by an attendant, whose left hand is on Mara’s hip. Cf.
A.G-B.G. ﬁgs. 201, 403. In upper right, another of Mara’s attendants is holding an uncertain
object in both hands. Possibly this is one of Mara’s daughters looking in her mirror, but this
is very questionable. Of the demon army only one ﬁgure, standing on its head on the right
edge of the panel, is represented. Cf. A.G-B.G. ﬁg. 203 and no. 105 supra. On the extreme
right are indications of a lost panel with bead-and-reel moulding. Of phyllite. Height 8 in.
Kn. ’31—87; octagonal room in A1; 1 ft. 9 in. below surface. Cf. pp. 328—9 supra. (Pl. 226,
no. 196.)

197. Small enframed panel of phyllite showing the haloed Buddha seated on a low throne
under a tree in the attitude of benediction (abhaya-mudra). On either side is a youthful yaksha,
naked save for necklace and armlet, standing with hands clasped in adoration. Height 3-12 in.
In. ’18—12; room 2, inside a niche. Cf. p. 385 supra. (Pl. 226, no. 197.)

198. Fragment from left of relief depicting the ‘Miracle of Sravasti’, showing ﬁve small
Buddha ﬁgures, seated in various attitudes on lotus blossoms, supported by their stems. Traces
of similar ﬁgures, now lost, and of haloes of others. Cf. nos. 122, 123, I29 supra, and A.G-B.G.
ﬁg. 79. Of phyllite. Height 18-25 in. Dh. ’13—766; N1; 3 ft. below surface.

199. Fragment of phyllite relief with ﬁgures much defaced. On left, traces of halo of lost
Buddha ﬁgure. Right of this is the head of a ﬁgure holding handle of dagger or broken sword
and above this is an elephant’s head with upraised trunk, and behind that, again, another
defaced animal—possibly a bull. In the upper background is a fully clothed, haloed but
mutilated ﬁgure, right hand to chest, left holding a bag or purse(?). The animals and armed
ﬁgure are suggestive of ‘Mara’s attack’, but the haloed ﬁgure in the background is unusual.
Height 13-5 in. Dh. ’13—472; between L and D3; 2 ft. below surface. Cf. p. 151 supra.
