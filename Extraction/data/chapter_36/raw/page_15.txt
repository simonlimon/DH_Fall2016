on the other side, clasps his hands in adoration or entreaty. Behind Brahma are two standing
ﬁgures, one a haloed deity, the other defaced; and behind Indra is ahigh-caste personage, whose
hands, again, are clasped in front of the body. There are traces of a lost ﬁgure on the extreme
right. Cf. A.G-B.G. ﬁgs. 164, b, 347, a, 348. Height 8-75 in. Cf. p. 251 supra; A.S.R. (1912),
P1. IX, e. Dh. ’12—772; between L and D 5; 5 ft. 6 in. below surface. (Pl. 217, no. 93.)

94. Image of the Buddha without head or hands, seated on a double lotus which rests, in
turn, on a pedestal. The hands were probably in the dharmacakra—mudrd. The chief interest
lies in the pedestal, which was supported at each of the front corners by the forefront of an
elephant and adorned on its face by a has-relief giving another rendering of the Samcodana.
Cf. no. 93 supra. The elephant on the left is missing, but the rest of the ﬁgures are intact. In
the centre of the relief the Bodhisattva, with a large halo and wearing ear-rings and an elaborate
turban, is seated in meditation on a low throne with wide, spreading back. To his left, Brahma
is seated on a similar chair, in pensive attitude, his head resting on his right hand, his right
elbow on his knee. Indra, with his hands clasped in entreaty, sits on a similar chair to the
Bodhisattva’s right. On either side of the central ﬁgure, between him and the seated gods, is
a standing ﬁgure, the one on the Bodhisattva’s left a monk, the other defaced. Cf. A.G-B.G.
ﬁg. 479. Of phyllite. Height 12-25 in. Cf. jauliaﬁ Mem. Pl. XVIII, b. In. ’I6—F1; lower stﬁpa-
court. Cf. p. 384 supra. (Pl. 218‘, no. 94.)

95. Fragment of curved relief, possibly from the right upper side of a false gable—window,
depicting the Samcodana or Instigation. Cf. nos. 93, 94 supra. In the centre of the original
panel, but on the left edge of the fragment, are traces of a haloed Bodhisattva, seated in European
fashion on a chair, the back of which is well displayed. To his left is a haloed deity, presumably
Indra, seated in easy attitude on a rattan seat, his right hand upraised entreating the Bodhisattva
to leave the world. Behind the Bodhisattva are two defaced attendant gods. Of phyllite.
Height 875 in. Cf. p. 267 supra; A.S.R. (1914), P1. XIII, d. Dh. ’14—239; P7; surface debris.

96. Fragment, from left side of some large composition, showing a haloed deity or Bodhi-
sattva, seated in European fashion on a chair, his bare feet on a low footstool, the front of
which is embellished by ﬁve large roundels. The face is turned half-right and the right hand
upraised in front of the breast. The ﬁgure wears the dress and ornaments common to devas
and Bodhisattvas. Such ﬁgures occur in the more ﬂorid representations of the Miracle of
Sravasti, but usually with a lotus under the feet. Cf. A.G-B.G. ﬁg. 79. Of phyllite. Height
9-12 in. Kn. ’32—321; A1; surface debris. Cf. pp. 328—9 supra.

97. Fragment of relief depicting a haloed Bodhisattva seated in an unusual attitude on an
exceptionally high, draped throne, the bottom right edge of which shows traces of simple
ornament. The right knee is bent, the foot resting on the throne; the left leg hangs in easy pose
in front of the throne, the missing foot apparently resting on a footstool, now indicated by the
fracture of the stone. The left hand lies in the lap, the right elbow on the right knee; the right
hand is now lost. The missing face was probably turned half—left. In the background, on either
side of the Bodhisattva, are two defaced, haloed deities; their clasped hands possibly held
offerings. Traces of attendant ﬁgures, one haloed, are seen in the upper background. Of
phyllite. Height 20 in. Cf. A.S.R. (1914), P1. IX, 1). Dh. ’14—747; B17; 5 ft. 3 in. below surface.
Cf. p. 249 supra. ,

98. Fragment from a large relief depicting the ‘Sleep of the Women’, probably the same
from which nos. 99 and 100 infra also come. Cf. A.G—B.G. ﬁg. 179. In centre is a female
drummer, fallen asleep over her drum, one leg on either side of it and her head resting on her
two hands on the top of it. The face is hidden but the head is crowned by a chaplet with
a large lotus ornament in front, and a line of beads across the top of the head connects the front
and back of the chaplet. Besides these, she also wears bracelets and ornamental ﬂat anklets. To
the right of the relief is the right leg and elbow of a second ﬁgure. Of phyllite. Height 13' 5 in.
Dh. ’12—508; L; 3 ft. 9 in. below surface. Cf. p. 251 supra. (Pl. 218, no. 98.)
