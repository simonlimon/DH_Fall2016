doubt derived from the West; it is frequently seen in Gandhara and still more frequently in
Mathura reliefs. For the bird motif on this comb, cf. B.M. Guide to Greek and Roman Life, no.

CLASS VI. Hair-pins (nos. 24—34)

These are made of both bone and ivory, and range in date from the ﬁfth century
3.0. to the ﬁrst century A.D. Only two specimens, however, have been found in the
Bhir Mound site and both of them have plain knob heads (nos. 24., 25). The pins
with ornamental heads come exclusively from Sirkap, and with one exception
(no. 26) are referable to the Saka-Parthian period. Most characteristic of the motifs
carved on the heads are the inverted comb and standard cock, the latter of which
seems to be copied from Hellenistic prototypes. There is also a peculiar wave
design with projecting mouldings on either side (no. 29). Less distinctive are the
heads of nos. 28 and 33, which take the form of a bell or pot capital with incised
rings below.

24.. Hair-pin of bone, with separate knob head of shell. Length 156 in. Bm. ’19—1,829;
sq. 56-6’; stratum IV. (Pl. 199, no. 24 and P1. 206, no. 15.)

25. Fragment of ivory hair-pin with knob head. Length 162 in. Bm. ’21—237; sq. 22-59’;
stratum III. (Pl. 199, no. 25.)

26. Bone hair-pin, with head in form of inverted comb set up on base. Length 4-87 in.
The comb as an ornamental or amuletic motif was familiar in India as far back as the Indus
period (M.I.C. p. 105 and P13. X01 and XCII) and is also found on punch-marked coins.I
Here it was evidently substituted for the open-hand motif found on Greek and Roman pins
and used frequently as a lucky amulet.2 Sk. ’29—2,621; Block B’; sq. 3 5-85’; stratum VI.
Cf. p. 129 supra. (Pl. 206, no. 18.)

27. Hair-pin of bone, with head in form of cock standing on tree. Length 3- 5 in. See nos. 30
and 32 below. The bird motif is also found on early pins from Luristan and on Greek and
Roman pins, specimens of which may be seen in the Room of Greek and Roman Life in the
British Museum. Sk. ’29—2,556; BlockA’; sq. 23'87’; stratum IV. Cf. p. 13 5 supra. (Pl. 206,
no. 16.)

Sk. ’29—1,057; Sixth Street (west); sq. 66-113’; stratum IV. Cf. p. 13 5 supra. (Pl. 199, no. 28
and P1. 206, no. 20.)

Length 325 in. Sk. ’26—2,969; Block F; sq. 93'50’; stratum III. Cf. p. 166 supra. (Pl. 199,
