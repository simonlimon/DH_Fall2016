654 BONE AND IVORY OBJECTS [CH. 32

oriﬁce of the ear. Some are solid; others pierced with a hole at the centre. They
have been found only in the Bhir Mound, in stratum IV. For other objects from
the same early stratum, with which these ear—reels should have been included, see

vol. I, p. 102.
5. Ear-reel of ﬁne ivory, with one side convex and hole through centre, by which the reel
may have been suspended on a cord. Diam. 0-93 in. Bm. ’24—881; sq. 7-57’; stratum IV.

(Pl. 199, no. 5.)
6. Similar, well turned on the lathe. One side slightly concave and decorated with incised

concentric circles round a central projection. Diam. 1 in. Bm. ’21—345; sq. 30-13’; stratum IV.

(Pl. 199, no. 6.)
7. Similar, of bone, with hole through centre. It is of exceptionally large size. Diam.

1-31 in. Bm. ’19—2,090; spoil earth. (P1. 199, no. 7.)

CLASS III. Gadrooned or amalaka beads (nos. 8—11)

This class of ornamental bead comes only from the Bhir Mound and dates from
the sixth to third centuries B.C. All the specimens are of bone and divided into
eight gadroons. The Indian term dmalaka is adopted from the dmalaka or gadrooned
sphere or wheel with which the s’ikham of a Hindu temple is usually crowned
and which, in its turn, derived its name from the dmalaka fruit. Beads of the
same shape but made of faience are found in Sirkap. They seem to have been

fashionable in the ﬁrst century A.D.

8. Amalaka—shaped bead of bone with eight gadroons and a hole through centre. Diam.
I in. Bm. ’19—1,978; sq. 10-38’; stratum IV. (P1. 199, no. 8.)
9. Similar, with hole plugged up. Diam. 0-87 in. Brn. ’21~175; sq. 8-51’; stratum IV.

(Pl. 199, no. 9.)
10. Similar to no. 8. Diam. 1-12 in. Bm. ’21—262; sq. 21—59’; stratum IV.

11. Similar to no. 9. Diam. 0-68 in. Bm. ’24—180; sq. 9-60’; stratum II. (P1. 199, no. 11.)

CLASS IV. Pendants and amulets (nos. 12—17)

Most of the articles in this class are dagger—shaped pendants of bone or ivory.
Nos. 13 and 14 come from the Bhir Mound and are referable to the fourth to third
century B.C.; nos. 15 and 16, from Sirkap and Hathial, may belong to the century
following, but their date is problematical. Another and earlier object of quasi-
human form from the Bhir Mound (no. 12, c. ﬁfth century 3.0.) was in all proba-
bility also a pendant, but might have been a child’s toy. The little tooth or horn
amulet no. 17, which is bound about the centre with a strip of copper, is akin to
a tooth amulet of gold and lead from the Bhir Mound. Cf. ‘Gold and Silver
Jewellery ’, ch. 30, no. 80, where references are given to the use of such amulets by
the Greeks and Romans, the former of Whom may conceivably have introduced

them at T axila.

12. Ivory object in quasi-human form. Height 2- 5 in. Probably it was a pendant, but may
have been a child’s toy. Very similar ﬁgures are classed as toys by Flinders Petrie, Objects of
Daily Use, P1. LV, no. 600. It is provided with a small hole near the top, for suspension.

Bm. ’24—937; sq. 15-55’; stratum IV. (Pl. 199, no. 12.)
