CLASS VIII. Handles of mirrors, fan, combs and other articles (nos. 43—59)

Like the metal mirrors themselves (‘Copper and Bronze ’, nos. 208—1 1), mirror-
handles come exclusively from Sirkap and are referable to the ﬁrst century B.C.
and A.D. Mirrors are one of the many things introduced from the Greek Orient
either by the Greeks themselves or by their successors, the Sakas or the Parthians.
Their handles are made of both bone and ivory, and fall into two classes, viz.:
(a) those decorated with ﬁgure-carvings in relief, and (1)) those turned on the lathe
and decorated with mouldings and incised lines and hatching.

Type a. Handles of mirrors carved in relief.

43. Bone handle, with the ﬁgure of a woman carved in relief on one side. She wears long
ear ornaments, necklace with pendant, girdle, heavy anklets and bangles. The bone is hollow.
For the anklets, cf. ‘ Gold and Silver Jewellery’, nos. 148—65. Length 6-31 in. Sk. ’28—2,483;
Block F'; sq. 91-92’; stratum IV. Cf. pp. 135, I83 supra. (P1. 203, k.)

44. Similar, of rough workmanship. The woman’s hair is dressed in a plain mass on either
side of head. Length 6-2 in. Sk. ’37; sq. 72-75’; Main Street; stratum II.

45. Similar. Length 5-25 in. Feet and anklets missing. The woman wears a garland on her
head, as in no. 47 and in numerous stucco and other ﬁgures of the Parthian period. The
‘diamond and reel’ motif of her girdle resembles that found in stone carvings of the Early
Indian School. Observe the long pendants on either side of the head, which, like those in
no. 46, seem to be suspended from the head—dress, not from the ears. There is a socket-hole
in the right top corner to take the tenon of the mirror. Sk. ’28~I,777; Block F’; sq. 8 5-89’;
stratum II. Cf. p. 183 supra. (Pl. 203, l.)

46. Similar to preceding, but without garland; and the girdle consists of a plain broad band.
Length 6-75 in. M1. ’20—91; sq. 63-84’; 2 ft. 6 in. below surface. Cf. p. 215 supra. (Pl. 203, m.)

47. Handle of bone, broader than the preceding specimens, with male and female ﬁgures
standing side by side. The male ﬁgure (to the left) wears a garment falling over his left shoulder,
garland on head, bangles and girdle. The female wears her hair dressed in a double tier,
crossed breast chain, bangles, girdle and anklets. The workmanship is crude and primitive.
