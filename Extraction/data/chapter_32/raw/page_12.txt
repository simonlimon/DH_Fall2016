CLASS XVI. Knuckle-bones (no. 99)

Knuckle-bones (o’ro'rpétyomm) were used by the Greeks from an early age for
playing a game somewhat similar to dice. Later the word dGTpc'ryoOxm was
applied to dice proper, but they continued to have only four ﬂat sides, the other two
being round. The four ﬂat sides were marked with the number I (represented by
a pip as in the dice of Class XV) opposite to 6, and 3 opposite to 4. ‘ The numbers
2 and 5 were wanting. In playing they threw four éoTpc'xyorAOI out of the palm of
the hand or from a box (Tri'pros). The best throw ((56709), when each die came up
differently, was called ’Aq9p05i'rn or Mi8ag or ‘HporKAﬁs; the worst, when all the
dice came up alike, KUwv.’ (Liddell and Scott, Lex. s12. dO'Tpéq/ockos.)

99. The only astragaloi found at Taxila were a large group of the old-fashioned, uncut
knuckle-bones, such as are depicted in Greek vase paintings of the fourth and ﬁfth centuries

B.C. They were unearthed in Block F'; sq. 89—90-97’; stratum III. Cf. p. 182 supra.

CLASS XVII. Toy furniture or miniature chests (nos. 100—4)

These articles are usually made of ivory (there is only one of bone), and
are referable to the ﬁrst century AD. They call to mind the toy furniture from

Hawara in Roman Egypt ﬁgured in Flinders Petrie, Objects of Daily Use, Pl. LIV,
554 and 555, though the latter is more roughly made. The specimens described

below, all from Sirkap, seemingly belong to six different pieces—probably
