Chapter 32. BONE AND IVORY
OBJECTS

ONE AND IVORY were used at T axila for the manufacture of a multitude
of small objects of daily use: personal ornaments, toilet and domestic
articles, gamesmen, toy furniture, and other miscellaneous things. All
of these objects, however, were not manufactured at the same time.

Some classes of them have been found only in the Bhir Mound; others only in
Sirkap; while others are common to both sites. Those which come only from the
Bhir Mound and are anterior to the middle of the second century B.C. are: ear-
reels (nos. 5—7), gadrooned beads (nos. 8—1 1),I ﬂesh-rubber (no. 60), spindle-whorls
(nos. 82—4), draughtsmen or counters (nos. 85—91), and a doll (no. 121). Those
which occur only in Sirkap and are referable to the period between the second
century B.C. and the ﬁrst century A.D. are: combs (nos. 18—23), ear-cleaners and
toothpicks (nos. 39—42), handles of mirrors and fan (nos. 43—5, 47—52, 54—7), knife-
handles (nos. 61—5), spoons (nos. 67—8), playing dice (nos. 92—8), knuckle—bones
(no. 99), toy furniture (nos. 100—4) and cheek-bars for horses’ bridles (nos. 1 I 5—17).
Articles that are found on both sites comprise: bangles (nos. 1, 2), pendants and
amulets (nos. 12—15, 17), hair-pins (nos. 24—34), antimony-rods (nos. 35—8), comb-
handles (nos. 58, 59), writing stili (nos. 69—81)2 and arrow-heads (nos. 10 5—14).

Many of these articles are traceable to a Greek or Western Asiatic origin. Such
are the hair—combs, hair-pins with comb and cock heads, ear-cleaners and tooth-
picks in combination, mirror-handles, writing stili, knuckle-bones (do‘rpc’xyaﬁor),
the tooth amulet no. 17, the ivory ram’s head no. 119, and the ivory pendant or
handle with the two philosophers’ heads no. 120. The two last, indeed, were in all
probability imports from the West. The cheek—bars for horses’ bridles (nos. I I 5—18)
seem likely to have been introduced by the Parthians from Central Asia.

Some general remarks on bone and ivory objects from the Bhir Mound will be
found in vol. I at pp. 102, 105 and 109, and on those from Sirkap at pp. 129, 13 5,
204—9. Other references are given in the individual entries of the catalogue below.

GROUP A. PERSONAL ORNAMENTS

Comprising bangles, ear—reels, gadrooned beads, pendants and amulets.

CLASS I. Bangles (nos. 1—4)

The materials commonly used for bangles were shell and copper for the cheaper
sorts, silver and gold for the more expensive ones. Bone or ivory was occasionally
used in place of shell, but only one or two specimens of these materials have been

I Gadrooned beads of faience, however, are common in the Saka-Parthian period.
