They take the form of short rods of bone, ivory, copper, bronze or lead, measuring from 3 to 6 in. in length. If required for smearing antimony or kohl round the eyes the rod is slightly clubbed; if required as a toothpick or nail- cleaner, it is pointed; if as an ear-cleaner, it is furnished with a tiny scoop. Some of the rods are clubbed at both ends; others have a club at one end and a point or scoop at the other; others have a point at one end and a scoop at the other. The earliest specimens found at Taxila date from the third, or possibly fourth, century 3.0.; the latest from the ﬁrst century AD. In the earliest specimens from the Bhir Mound, bone or ivory is used for the simple clubbed antimony-rod, copper for the antimony-rod and ear-cleaner combined. In the later specimens from Sirkap, bone, ivory, copper, bronze and lead are used for the antimony-rods; bone, ivory and copper for the combination of ear-cleaner and toothpick; and copper only for the combination of antimony-rod and toothpick. The combination of antimony-rod and ear-cleaner has not been found in Sirkap. Antimony-rods or kohl—sticks, as they are sometimes called, were used in Egypt and the West from a very early age, and it is not unlikely that they and the ear-cleaners were introduced at TaXila by the Greeks. The usual Greek word for antimony was G'riuut or oﬁul. Ear-cleaners were called o’o'royluois by the Greeks, auriscalpz'um by the Romans. The clubbed antimony-rod was doubtless used also for ordinary painting under the eyes with lamp-black (é’toﬂohos).

Some have a ﬁne smooth point, others a ball point. In some, again, the butt is ﬂattened like a chisel for smoothing out the wax; in others it is rounded.

Later the word dGTpc'ryoOxm was applied to dice proper, but they continued to have only four ﬂat sides, the other two being round. The four ﬂat sides were marked with the number I (represented by a pip as in the dice of Class XV) opposite to 6, and 3 opposite to 4. ‘ The numbers 2 and 5 were wanting. In playing they threw four éoTpc'xyorAOI out of the palm of the hand or from a box (Tri'pros).

WEAPONS AND HORSE—BRIDLES The bone and ivory arrow—heads from Taxila are of four types, viz. : (a) roughly shaped and sharpened at both ends. These are the objects which Cunningham took to be ‘ spillikins ’ or ‘ tip-cats ’, but they are much too small for the game in question and there can no longer be any doubt that they served as arrow-heads; (b) with smooth circular point and well-deﬁned tang; (c) with a point similar to (b) but with a hollow socket—hole behind for the shaft—tenon; (d) with a trilateral point and hollow socket—hole behind. Type (a) is found in both the Bhir Mound and Sirkap and was in use from the ﬁfth or sixth century B.C. to the ﬁrst century A.D.; but the earlier Bhir Mound specimens are distinguished from the Sirkap ones by having the point of the arrow-head somewhat better ﬁnished than the tang. Types ([2), (c) and (d) are found exclusively in the Bhir Mound and date from the fourth and third centuries B.C. Kautilya (bk. II, ch. 18) mentions arrows tipped with bone or wood as well as with metal, but these bone and ivory arrow-heads from Taxila could hardly have been intended for serious warfare, unless they were poisoned. Possibly they were employed for practice archeryI or for shooting birds; or it may be that they were found useful for the town police as being less deadly than iron ones. The following are typical specimens: Type a. Roughly shaped and sharpened at both ends.",204.-q,Sk,3,1928

For another ram’s head carved on a scaraboid seal, see ‘Seals and Sealings’, ch. 34, no. 11. Both objects come from the Bhir Mound and are referable to the same period.
