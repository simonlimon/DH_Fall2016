(P1.134, no. 71. ) These comprise elephants, horses, humped bulls, a camel, dog(?), rams, wild goats(?), birds and monkeys. Elephants Terra-cotta elephants are found in both the Bhir Mound and Sirkap. Some have riders, some not. Some are quite plain, others are provided with trappings, and others, again, are adorned with stamped designs. As a rule, the earlier specimens from the Bhir Mound are more ornamental than the later from Sirkap. No. 72, however, from the Bhir Mound is quite plain, and no. 73 from the same site has only a girth and neck ropes to relieve its plainness, but most of the Bhir Mound specimens are embellished with a variety of small patterned squares or triangles or circles or lozenges stamped on the surface of the head and trunk. One elephant only of this class comes from Sirkap, viz. no. 75, and in this case there is only one stamped device instead of several, and the workmanship has become noticeably cruder. Some effort towards decoration has been made in the case of the Sirkap elephant no. 76, but the ornament consists only of a row of incised circles to indicate the girth, and a group of similar circlets on the head to indicate perhaps the head‰ÛÓcloth. The few examples of these elephants which carry riders come exclusively from the Bhir Mound, and are easily recognisable from the peculiar way in which the legs and seats of the riders are •Ââattened against the body of the elephants. Evi- dently the toy-makers from TaXila had much greater di•Ââiculty in giving the riders a natural seat on the backs of these great beasts than the sculptors of Si•Âchi had. Possibly they were not so much at home with the elephant as were their fellow craftsmen of Central India and Hindustan. It is evident, too, that in the pre‰ÛÓGreek period represented on the Bhir Mound these toy elephants were much greater favourites than later on, when the Maurya rule had been replaced by the Yavana. As regards technique, most of the elephants are solid throughout, but a few of the largest ones from the Bhir Mound (e.g. nos. 78 and 79), like some of the largest horses, have hollow bodies and legs. This is for the sake of lightness. Such speci‰ÛÓ mens are not very well modelled nor are they embellished with stamped designs. With few exceptions, the clay is red and well-burnt but without any slip, though in one or two of the better examples a wash has been applied to the surface. Only rarely is the clay grey-black, e.g. in no. 76 and in the miniature elephants nos. 80 and 81. The tusks are of one piece with the rest of the beast, not inserted, as they sometimes are in other parts of India, into sockets. The eye is generally diamond‰ÛÓshaped and stamped, but sometimes lozenge-shaped. CH. 24] TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 455",P1.134-71.,Sk,6,,2475,,,, XVII.

From Sirkap there come also a number of moulds which appear to have been used by ancient coin-forgers, just as such moulds are used by present-day forgers. The moulds take the form of •Ââat circular tablets of terra-cotta, with the impress of half a d0zen or a dozen coins in each, the coins being those of the Saka kings, Maues and Azes II. The moulds themselves appear to date from the closing years of the Parthian rule at Taxila, when the kings whose coins are •Âgured on them had long since passed away. It is well known, however, and there is abundant evidence at Taxila itself to show, that these and many other coins, some even older than the issues of Maues, continued in circulation throughout the Parthian period, and no doubt the forgers, whoever they were, found it safer to copy the older issues rather than to forge the current coins of the realm.

Among the many objects of earthenware from the Bhir and Sirkap Mounds it remains only to describe certain small votive or ritual tanks of a kind virtually new to Indian archaeology. These tanks do not number more than •Âfteen in all, inclusive of fragments, and out of this number four were found, as already stated,‰Û÷ alongside the base of the small st•Âpa in the Parthian palace of Sirkap, where they were still evidently occupying the places where they had originally been dedicated; a •Âfth was lying loose in the debris near by, and two others were found in the court‰ÛÓ yard of the st•Âpa in Block A. As there are grounds for believing that these two st•Âpas were Jaina rather than Buddhist structures, and as none of the tanks has been found at any of the innumerable Buddhist st•Âpas at Taxila, it is not unreason- able to surmise that they were particularly connected with Jaina ritual. Earliest type a. In the earliest form represented at Taxila the votive tank consists merely of a round bowl with a number of miniature saucer-shaped lamps round its rim. Three specimens only of this type have been found: two in the Bhir Mound, and one in the lowest stratum of Sirkap. They are assignable to the third and second centuries B.C. In the Bhir Mound examples the rim is not •Ââattened; in the Sirkap example it is.","136-p, 136-q, 136-1'",Sk,,,24155,156,49,K, XXIII. Votive or ritual tanks (nos. 153‰ÛÓ63),"156,49","1 5 5.

Type c. The third type is more elaborate. On one side of the tank is a small shrine with a primitive-looking idol of a goddess either inside or in front of it. In most examples the shrine is placed on the rim of the tank, with two small posts to support its front, and there is a •Ââight of steps descending from one side of it to the bottom of the tank (nos. 158‰ÛÓ9). Generally the idol stands beside the steps about half an inch above the •Ââoor; but in one example (no. 160) the shrine itself is placed on the •Ââoor of the tank with the idol inside it. Usually the shrine is in the form of a rectangular chamber, shallow from front to back and with or without a pillar in the middle of the facade. In one example, however (no. 161), which comes from stratum III, the shrine is deeper and pro‰ÛÓ vided with a high-pitched roof; and in another still earlier example (no. 163) the tank, which may have been circular, was divided by cross walls into quarters, and a circular shrine was set on the dividing walls at the point of intersection.

MM , m åÈ<*\,W CH. 24] TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 465 A few other specimens of these votive tanks have also been recovered from among the ruins of Sirkap, for the most part in a fragmentary state; but as they are merely duplicates of the foregoing, it would be super•Ââuous to describe them. The questions that we must now endeavour to answer are, •Ârst, what was the signi•Âcance and purpose of these interesting tanks, and secondly, how came they to be dedicated at these st•Âpas, whether Jaina or Buddhist? One thing, clear before all else, is that they are intimately connected with the cult of the nude goddess whose shrine and miniature idol stand, in many of the specimens, on one side of the tank. Probably this was the Great Mother-goddess whose cult was ubiquitous in ancient India and went back to immemorial times. It was this same Mother‰ÛÓ goddess, as I have elsewhere shown,I whose terra-cotta images are found at Mohenjo-daro and other sites of the Chalcolithic Age, who appears •Âgured on the thin gold plate found by the late Dr Bloch in the heart of a prehistoric funeral tumulus at Lauriya Araraj,2 and who is carved in relief on the inner side of certain ringstones of Maurya date‰ÛÓthemselves possessed of magic properties associated with fertility•Â Then, another obvious feature of these tanks is that they are symbolical of the four elements and of all creation: of earth, air, •Âre and water, and of all the beings that live in them‰ÛÓthe earth symbolised by the clay of which the tank is made, the air by the birds, the •Âre by the lamps, and the water by the aquatic creatures within, as well as by the water itself with which the tank was partly •Âlled. Such symbolism calls for no recondite explanation, for there is no reason for supposing that it implies anything more than that, in the eyes of the votary, the goddess was supreme over the four elements and all created things contained in them. That, at any rate, is an adequate explanation, beyond which it is hardly necessary to go. We should not forget, however, that tanks have a certain peculiar sanctity of their own in India, partly because they are the familiar adjuncts of countless shrines and temples throughout the length and breadth of the land, partly because of the all‰ÛÓimportant part they play in the ceremonial ablutions of the worshippers. An eX-voto, therefore, consisting of a miniature shrine with a tank by its side would be a very natural and appropriate form of offering. But why‰ÛÓand this is the second question we have to answer‰ÛÓshould these ritual tanks which appertained to an essentially Hindu cult, have been dedicated at Jaina or‰ÛÓ'‰ÛÓif there is any doubt about them being Jaina‰ÛÓat Buddhist st•Âpas? The answer is to be found in the contamination which has taken place in every religion known to us, and which in the •Ârst century AD. was affecting Jainism as much as it was affecting Buddhism. However philosophic and abstract in their essence these two religious systems may originally have been, it was inevitable that they should take much of their subsequent colour from the primitive and long- established faiths of the people, and that, as they cast their nets wider and wider among the many nations of India and its varied classes of society, they should I See M.I.C. vol.

Connexion with cult of Mother- goddess Symbolism of the four elements Sanctity of tanks in India Fusion of older cuts with Buddhism and Jainism Connexion of ritual tanks with the dead           466 TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [CH. 24 absorb into themselves many beliefs and concrete cultural practices undreamt of by their founders. In the case of Buddhism it is well known how much current folklore went to the making of the jdtakas, and if we turn to the sculptures of Bharhut and Si•Âchi‰ÛÓour surest and safest guides to the character of popular Buddhism in the •Ârst century B.C.‰ÛÓwe •Ând evidence on every hand of the extent to which the Sakya faith had amalgamated with the cults and superstitions of an earlier age, and become blended with them into the newer Buddhism. Thus we see in these sculptures how Lakshmi, ancient goddess of prosperity and domestic happiness, had been transformed into Maya, the mother of the Blessed One; how the magic Tree of Life and Fortune still continued to shower its blessings on the Buddhists, as it had showered them from time immemorial on their ancestors; and how yakshas and yakshis, ndgas and ndgis played just as real and Vital a part in the new faith as they had done in the old. It can hardly surprise us, therefore, to •Ând these little shrines and tanks of the Mother-goddess dedicated by Jaina suppliants at the foot of their st•Âpas. They are only another illustration of the inevitable fusion that was taking place between the primitive cults of pre‰ÛÓAryan India and a creed which was largely above the heads of the masses. The process is one which can still be seen going on in Burma, where images of the old indigenous Nats are still being set up as guardian genii round many of the Buddhist pagodas, as these small •Âgures of the Mother-goddess were no doubt meant to protect the Taxila st•Âpas. It may be, too, that this form of votive offering had some special signi•Âcance in connexion with the dead; for the st•Âpa, be it remembered, was in origin a burial tumulus and there is no reason to suppose that its original character was ever lost sight of. I make this suggestion because small tanks of a somewhat similar kind to those we are discussing are still in use in Bengal in connexion with certain rites to Yama, the god of Death,‰Ûª known as Yama-pukur-bmta. The rites are performed by unmarried girls for four consecutive years and for a full month beginning with the last day of the month Aswin and ending with the last day of Kartik: that is, from the middle of October to the middle of November. The following is the manner of the rites. A tiny tank, about a cubit square with a channel on one side, is dug in the courtyard of the house, and on the eastern side of it are placed plants of rice, banana, turmeric, tulsi,I main,2 kalmi,3 and susm',4 all tied together in a bundle. Then a cowry, a betel nut and a piece of turmeric are placed at each of the four corners of the tank. Next, a number of small •Âgures are made from the excavated earth, viz. a crocodile, an eel, a tortoise, a shark, sixteen dolls representing washer- men, •Âshermen and others, and a number of crows, cranes, kites and other birds. Of these, the crocodile, shark, eel and tortoise are placed on the edges of the tank, the two latter near the channel, the birds stuck on little sticks are planted in the middle of the tank, and of the sixteen dolls four are set on each of the banks. Thereafter, an e•Ââ'igy of Yama is made lying in his mother‰Ûªs lap, and is placed on the eastern edge beside the bundle of plants; and lastly, lamps are lit at the corners of ‰Û÷ Ocimum sanctum. 2 Alocasz'a Indica. 3 Ipomaea aquatica. 4 Mam'lea quadrzfolia. ‰Û÷ t g 3 CH. 24] TERRA‰ÛÓGOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 467 the tank. The girls then proceed to make offerings to Yama and his mother by casting •Ââowers into the tank and pouring water therein, while they recite certain mantras, bowing down and praying for long life and prosperity for their families and themselves. When the mantras and prayers are •Ânished, two tales are told by the girls about the powers of the Yama-pukur-brata and the evils that come to those who interfere with the ritual ;I and on the last day of the ceremonies, at the end of the fourth year, the girls give food to Brahmans, and to a cowboy they give an umbrella, a piece of cloth, a pair of shoes, a stick and ten cowry shells. Here, then, in this Yama‰ÛÓpulsar of Bengal we have all the essential features of the votive tank at Taxila, viz. the square tank of water, the creatures that live in water, the birds of the air, and the lamps of •Âre, representing in both cases the four elements and all created things over which Yama, no less than the Great Mother-goddess, rules. A curious analogy to these votive tanks of Taxila is also presented by a class of earthenware models found in Egyptian graves of the Middle Empire, two examples of which are illustrated in P1. 136, bb, cc. To Egyptologists they are commonly known as ‰Û÷ soul‰ÛÓhouses ‰Ûª, and the former of the two examples illustrated (no. I 36, bb) is doubtless a model of an Egyptian house intended for the soul of the departed.2 The other (cc) is more probably in the nature of an ‰Û÷ offerings‰ÛÓdish‰Ûª, but, with its little lamp in one corner, it can hardly fail to remind us of the tank‰ÛÓshrines of Taxila, albeit the resemblance may be only a fortuitous one. A closer parallel to the latter is afforded by some votive models which were found a few years ago at Hephaestia in the Isle of Lemnos and described in the Illustrated London News3 by Dr Doro LÌ©vi. These ex-votos (Pl. 136, aa), which date from the sixth century B.C., consist of a miniature shrine (usually three-chambered) of terra-cotta, with a shallow tank in front, the latter being rectangular or semicircular in plan; and in the tank are various aquatic animals‰ÛÓeels, tortoises and the like‰ÛÓjust as there are in the Taxila tanks. Moreover, in the case of one of the specimens illustrated the resem‰ÛÓ blance is increased by the presence of a •Âgure seated on the edge of the tank in front of the shrine. That there is any immediate connexion between these tank- shrines from Hephaestia and those from Sirkap is, on the face of it, hardly probable, but it is by no means unlikely that both may go back to a common prototype which in the Chalcolithic Age may well have had a diffusion in the Near and Middle East as wide as the cult of the Great Mother-goddess herself. However this may be, there can be virtually no question that the votive tanks at Taxila were Indian in character. It is true that they occur very rarely in the Bhir Mound, and that such as have been found there are of a different type from those found in Sirkap, I For the brata and the tales told by the girls, see the appendix to this chapter, pp. 473‰ÛÓ5. 1 These so-called ‰Û÷soul-houses‰Ûª were not known, so far as I am aware, in Roman Egypt. A large number of beautiful specimens were found by Petrie at Rifeh and are published in his Giza]: and Rifeh. They date from the period between the VIth and XIth Dynasties. In Saite times they are also known, but of a very rough form. 3 Illustrated London News (28 Feb. 1931), pp. 328‰ÛÓ31. Cf. Arch. Anzeiger (I930), p. 14.6; }.H.S.

Against this inference, however, there are two un- answerable arguments. The •Ârst is that some broken tank-shrines of the same kind were found by the writer as far east as Bhiga near Allahabad‰ÛÓin the heart of Hindustan, Where the Parthians never penetrated.I The second is that the idols in the tank-shrines were of a type familiar in India from prehistoric times and such as were still, in the •Ârst century A.D., quite in keeping with popular ideas, but not such as foreign invaders from the West, whether Parthian, Scythian or Greek, are likely to have manufactured. We come now to a class of terra‰ÛÓcotta and clay •Âgures which are exclusively . Buddhist in character and altogether more impressive than the preceding examples. In style, they are generally similar to the Buddhist stucco sculptures described in chapter 26, but thanks to the greater plasticity of clay as compared with stucco and to the ease with which it can be handled, many of these •Âgures show a freedom in their modelling and a sensitiveness to form which was never quite attained in stucco work. With a few rare exceptions, all these •Âgures belong to the Indo-Afghan School of the fourth to •Âfth century A.D., and comprise, as we shall see, several pieces of surpassing merit. The smaller •Âgures were usually of terra-cotta throughout, that is, of clay •Âred in a kiln.

The oldest form of quern in India is the slab or saddle-quern, specimens of which have been found among the Chalcolithic ruins of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro (cf. M.I.C. pp. 25, 456‰ÛÓ7).

The Indian examples are usually decorated with simple designs, which, as time went on, became more and more ornamental. Whether this type of quern was used generally for the grinding of corn is questionable. The ornamental carvings on many of the specimens suggest that they were meant for the grinding of spices, karz', etc., rather than of corn. It is true that the earliest example of the circular grinding-mill found at Taxila is not earlier than the •Ârst century A.D., but it is quite possible that the grinding of cereals was chie•Âây done at or near the farms where the grain was grown, not in the city. On the other hand, the grinding-mill is found in most of the early medieval monasteries, and this fact, contrasted with its complete absence from any of the earlier settlements, goes far to show that it did not super- sede the quern until•Âafter the beginning of the Christian era.

In no. 27, the upper stone is convex above, concave underneath, thinning rapidly towards the edge, while the nether is convex above in order to •Ât with the upper one. As this grinding-mill was meant to be worked by two persons, the upper stone was provided with socket-holes for two handles.

Vessels made of stone are relatively few in the earlier Bhir Mound cities and are restricted to those of simple shapes‰ÛÓmortars (with pestles), dishes, saucers, bowls and cups. The stones used for them are the hard abrz' (lower cretaceous shell lime- stone) and hornblende-gneiss, soft steatite and alabaster, and the semi-precious rock crystal and agate. Of alabaster there is only one example‰ÛÓa saucer of pinkish- white colour, no. 42. Abri and hornblende-gneiss were used during this early period for pestles and mortars; alm' also for cups and bowls; steatite (soapstone) for bowls and dishes; crystal for little toilet-trays; and agate for ornamental bowls, of which there is only one example. These stones were usually turned on the lathe, but sometimes ground down by hand. - Schist, as already indicated, was not introduced at Taxila until after the advent of the Bactrian Greeks (c. 190 B.C.); but from that time onwards this soft stone CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 489 came more and more into vogue, •Ârst for simple articles like dishes and carved toilet-trays, but later on for a multitude of vessels and sculptures of all sorts. The earliest objects made of this stone are the two lathe‰ÛÓturned dishes nos. 38 and 39, and the two ornamental toilet-trays nos. 62 and 63,. all four of which are referable to the second century B.C. Later on, in the •Ârst century A.D., we •Ând schist being used for vases of many shapes, goblets, caskets, ladles and lamps, besides unguent- bottles and elaborately carved toilet‰ÛÓtrays. The three kinds of schist employed for these articles are the common grey schist of Gandhara, and a micaceous and hornblende schist from the same region; quartz mica-schist and the deep green chloritised mica-schist, favoured at this period by the sculptors of the North-West, were not used for household articles. Other soft stones employed during this period were steatite, phyllite, slate, claye stone and alabaster, but so far as Sirkap is concerned, no household objects made of these stones have been found in strata earlier than the Parthian, and even then their use is restricted to a few articles‰ÛÓmainly toilet‰ÛÓtrays and caskets. Specimens made of phyllite, slate, claystone and alabaster are very few; those of steatite are not so rare. During the Kushan period phyllite, as we shall see, was to become the favourite stone for sculpture, and other objects were to be made from it as well as from the other soft stones named above, which continued in use up to the early medieval period. With the introduction of schist for household vessels in the second century B.C., hard stones like gneiss and hornblende gradually ceased to be used for this purpose. Apart from pestles and mortars, for which particularly hard Varieties of stone are needed, only one example (no. 43) of a hard stone vessel has been found in Sirkap, and there is reason for believing that this was a survival from one of the earlier settlements. In regard to the use of agate for small bowls, cups, caskets, etc., the fragments of these vases found at Taxila correspond very closely with Pliny‰Ûªs description of the famous vasa myrrhina, which fetched such big prices at Rome. Pliny alleges that these vases came from Parthia and Carmania, but no importance need be attached to his statement, because, up to the time when the Red Sea route was opened up, the carrying trade between India and the West was exclusively in the hands of the Parthians, and it is hardly likely that the precise provenance of some of the goods - would be known to the Romans.I The manufacture of agate vases is an age-old industry in India, especially in Kathiawar and round about the gulf of Cambay, and there can be little doubt that it was from there that the Parthian merchants exported them to Italy. On the strength of a line of Propertius,2 it has been inferred (e.g. Ramsay and Lanciani, Manual of Roman Antiquities, p. 4.97), that the myrrhine vases must have been some sort of porcelain, but the foci referred to by Propertius were not ordinary kilns but the special trenched kilns in Which it was the Indian practice to roast agates and carnelians in order to bring out their colours. This process of burning agates was fully described by Barbosa as far back as I 517. Cf. Sir G. Watt, Commercial Products of India, p. 561, and Schoff, Periplus, pp. 193‰ÛÓ4. ‰Û÷ Schoff, Peri lus, .

CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 493 Nearly all the articles under this head belong to the class of round toilet-trays usually divided into two or more compartments and embellished with •Âgures or scenes sculptured in relief. Besides this impOrtant series of toilet‰ÛÓtrays there are a few miniature trays of rock-crystal, emanating from the Bhir Mound, which in all probability were also meant for the toilet table, and a larger tray of hornblende micaceous schist from Sirkap, which was used no doubt for household purposes. Type a. Toilet-trays. The ornamental toilet‰ÛÓtrays are made of schist, steatite, indurated claystone, slate or phyllite. Of the thirty-three specimens described below, thirteen are of grey schist, eleven of micaceous schist, •Âve of steatite, two of indurated claystone, one of slate, and one of phyllite or phyllitic slate. No. 64, which is probably of the Saka period, is of steatite, but with this exception all of pre‰ÛÓParthian date are of schist. The subjects portrayed in these toilet-trays are not numerous. They comprise the followmg: Subject No. of specimens (1) ‰Û÷Satyr and nymph . . . . . . . . . . I (2) Figure reclining on couch attended by femalesI 2 (3) Drinking and dancing scenes . . . . . . . . 2 (4) Pair of •Âgures (male and female) holding drinking-cups . 5 (5) Lions, leogryphs, winged stag, hippocamps and other •Âsh-tailed monsters with riders . . . . . . . . . . . 6 (6) Ditto, without riders . . . . . . . . . . I4 (7) Geometric and •Ââoral designs . . . . . . . . 3 Most of these subjects are clearly Hellenistic, and there can be no doubt that this kind of toilet-tray was introduced with Hellenistic culture from the West, where specimens of them have been found, especially in Egypt.2 Local Indian in•Ââuence, however, is to be seen in the lotus rosettes or leaves used as a background for many of the reliefs, in the makam-like treatment of some of the sea-monsters, and possibly also in the pairs of •Âgures holding drinking‰ÛÓcups, though, as to the last, it is perhaps more likely that this motif, so familiar in the early Mathura School, may also have had a Hellenistic origin. In point of style no. 62, which comes from the Graeco-Bactrian city, has a distinctive character of its own, which apart from its place of •Ânding would justify us in assigning it to the second century B.C. Instead of this tray being divided up, as nearly all the later examples are, into two or more compartments, the two •Âgures occupy the centre of the •Âeld and stand out with effective simplicity against the plain background. The •Âgures themselves are treated almost as if they were in the round, rather than in relief,3 and the modelling of their forms, albeit sketchy, ‰Û÷ The same subject is also represented on the lid of the vessel no. 106 infra. 2 E.g. Flinders Petrie, Objects of Daily Use, Pl. XXXIV, nos. 23‰ÛÓ31. 3 This characteristic of most Hellenistic relief work is shared also by the reliefs round the abacus of the Asoka capital at Sarnath, which, as I have shown elsewhere, was executed by a Greek or a Perso-Greek artist of the third century B.C. Cf. C.H.I. vol. I, p. 621, and Marshall and Foucher, The Monuments of S•Â•Âchi, pp. 87, 88. MT 63 494 STONE OBJECTS [CH. 25 is more conscientious than in the later trays. There is a certain distinctiveness, also, about the style of no. 63, which dates probably from the •Ârst century B.C. and re•Ââects the increasing decadence of Hellenistic art under Saka rule. The scene is of course a purely Greek one, and, although the •Âgures individually are crudely modelled and stiff and wooden in their poses, their composition still re•Ââects the older Hellenistic tradition. In no. 65, on the other hand, we recognise the effect of the Graeco‰ÛÓ Roman art popularised at Taxila under Parthian rule, with its more crowded •Âgures, and much greater freedom of composition and drawing; and we are on quite safe ground in referring to the same century (•Ârst century A.D.) nos. 64, 66 and 76. But, apart from these few specimens, it is di•Ââicult to determine the respective ages of these toilet-trays on the strength of their style alone. This dif•Âculty arises from the fact that, with the passing of the Bactrian Greeks and coming of the Sakas, Hellenistic art in India rapidly declined, but revived again in the •Ârst century under the rule of the Parthians, and though in the interim Hellenistic art in Western Asia had to some extent been Romanised and undergone considerable changes in consequence, nevertheless it is often impossible to determine whether a particular example of debased Indo-Hellenistic work was executed before or after the Parthian revival. And this is true not only of these stone carvings but of other branches of art as well. To be sure, the Indianised treatment of the couple in no. 70, so strongly reminiscent of the Mathura School, enables us to relegate this particular piece with con•Âdence to Parthian times, but it is not often that we get such light from the Indian side. Take, for example, nos. 78, 79 and 82. We infer from their •Ândspots that they probably belong to the Saka period, but from their style alone it would be impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to af•Ârm that they were not strays from the Parthian level above.

In centre, erotic scene: to left, standing male •Âgure, with hooded mantle over back; to right, kneeling woman clad in himation or shawl, which her companion is pulling from her. Beneath them, triple line of small rocks with larger rock on extreme right, which the woman holds with her left hand. On back of tray, full-blown lotus in low relief. This is a familiar scene in Greek art, the two •Âgures being usually a satyr and a nymph, e.g. Brit. Mus.

At head of couch, a draped female seated on stool, with awine-cup in left hand. Behind the couch, a second female, standing, with garland in upraised right hand. CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 495 The •Âgures are clad in the Greek chitou and himation. In the lower register, seven lines sug- gestive of a palniette. On rim, beaded border in low relief. This toilet‰ÛÓtray is referable to the •Ârst century B.C., when Hellenistic art was becoming barbarised under the rule of the Sakas. Observe that the •Âgures in this scene are more widely spaced than in the later Parthian reliefs, in this respect being nearer to the Hellenistic tradition, in spite of their stiff and rigid formality. The wig‰ÛÓlike treatment of the hair and the wide‰ÛÓopen, prominent eyes are peculiarly characteristic of nascent Gandhara sculpture during the late Saka period. These traits are well exempli•Âed also in nos. 70, 74 and 75, and in ‰Û÷Stone Sculptures‰Ûª, ch. 36, nos. 3, 4, 12, 13, etc. Cf. p. 693 infra.

Toilet-tray of greenish grey steatite (soapstone). Diam. 662 in. On rim, border of double arcading, incised. In centre, drinking scene.I Although the scene is a composite Whole, •Âlling virtually the entire •Âeld, it is divided by convention into three tiers separated one from the other by projecting •Ââoors, so that the •Âgures in the upper and middle parts of the •Âeld may have something on which to rest their feet. In the top register, in centre, a man and woman are seated on a bench, the former clasping his companion with his left arm and holding a sceptre with his right, while she offers him a cup of wine. To left of them, a woman seated and draped, playing on a lyre; and, behind her, a youth playing on the Pan-pipes; to right, a standing male •Âgure with his right hand wrapped in his mantle and his left holding a staff. In the middle register, to right, a large wine-vat, rising from acanthus leaves, in Which two men, one on the back of the other, are treading the grapes, while a lad, in the centre, draws off the juice in a tall •Ââagon (\‰Û÷J-rro7x•Âv10v). To the left, another man is carrying a wine-skin on his back and emptying its contents into a kmter, while his companion on the left of the vase is raising a bowl to his lips. Below, in the bottom register, two •Âgures are lying drunk. Framing the top of the scene from side to side is an undulating vine. The back of the plaque is relieved with concentric bands, both incised and in relief. Cf. A.S.R. (1928), P1. XIX, I and p. 56, no. 55. The style is typical of Hellenistic art of the •Ârst century A.D., and the relief is reminiscent of the ‰Û÷Wedding of Ariadne and Bacchus ‰Ûª‰ÛÓ-a familiar scene in Graeco-Roman art. 'Cf.

Four specimens of these singularly interesting stones have been found at Taxila‰ÛÓthree in the Bhir Mound and one in the second stratum of ‰Û÷ Sirkap, but the style and workmanship of the latter leave‰Û÷no room for doubt that it belongs to the same (Maurya) age as the others. The peculiar sanctity with which ring-stones are invested in India is well known and can be traced back to an immemorial age. Large numbers of them, dating from the fourth or third millen- nium B.C. have been unearthed at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa‰ÛÓsome no bigger than a •Ânger-ring, some so large that it takes half a dozen men to lift them; while among famous examples of to-day may be mentioned the Srigundi stone at Malabar Point near Bombay, which is believed to purify those who crawl through it of disease and sickness, and the equally potent one at Satrunjaya, the hole in which is known as muktdwdra=‰Û÷door of absolution‰Ûª‰ÛÓthe door which gives happiness to anyone who can creep through it. The idea underlying all these ring-stones is the same: they are regarded as yonis or female symbols of generationI‰ÛÓthe idea being that those who pass through them are, as it were, born again, while in the case of the smaller stones of the same class the mere passing of the hand or •Ânger through them is an act of special virtue. That the same idea attached to the specimens found at Taxila (probably ex‰Û÷voto offerings) is evident from the nude •Âgures of a ‰Û÷ goddess of Fertility‰Ûª which are engraved with consummate skill inside the central hole, thus indicating in a manner that cannot be mistaken the connexion between them and the female principle.2 It is not unlikely'that the ‰Û÷ Fertility goddess ‰Ûª here represented may have been identi•Âed with the ‰Û÷ Earth goddess ‰Ûª Prithivi. The earth itself was conceived of as wheel-shaped in the Rigveda,3 and it is said to be ‰Û÷ circular ‰Ûª in the Satapatha Brdhmazuz. A disk of terra-cotta bearing an image in relief of a ‰Û÷ Fertility goddess ‰Ûª was unearthed by me at Bhita in 191 1‰ÛÓ12, and is published in my Report for that year.4 It belongs to the Kushan or Early Gupta period and depicts the goddess with legs wide apart and with a lotus (emblem of birth) issuing from her neck in place of her head.

To the former class belong the thin disks of porcelain-agate referred to on pp. 478‰ÛÓ9 above. As there explained, these disks vary in diameter from 2 to 3 in., and in thickness from O'I to 0-2 in., and are polished only on the upper porcelain-like surface, not on the under- surface, which resembles opaline chalcedony. They come from the top strata of the Bhir Mound and from Sirkap, and are referable to the third and second centuries B.C.I Cf. p. 188 supra. In View of the unusual character of this porcelain-agate, hitherto unknown to geology, it is desirable to give here the results of the examination made by Prof. H. B. Baker at the Royal College of Science, South Kensington. An air-dried sample yielded the following analysis: % Silica 98-40 Ferric oxide and alumina 0-99 Lime 0-12 Magnesia 0-05 This corresponds very closely to an analysis of natural quartz, and the micro- scopic examination made by the Department of Geology points to the same conclusion, though no specimen of quartz has yet been found in a natural state which has the same peculiar arrangement of crystals. Prof. Baker endeavoured to reproduce the material by heating quartz for three months in an electric furnace to about the highest temperature of a furnace which would have been available in early times. This, he says, gave an opalescent material, which, however, was not identical microscopically with the sample of porcelain-agate examined. The quartz of these disks could not have been fused, since the substance has a speci•Âc gravity of 2-64, identical with that of natural quartz, compared with 2-38, the speci•Âc gravity of melted quartz. On fusion in the oxyhydrogen •Ââame a fragment •Ârst splits like ordinary quartz, and then fuses. 1 Their reference numbers are: Bm. ‰Ûª19‰ÛÓ1 17 (sq. 12-28‰Ûª; stratum I); Bm. ‰Ûª21‰ÛÓ966 (sq. 34-118‰Ûª; stratum I); Brn. ‰Ûª21‰ÛÓ1,426 (sq. 27-64‰Ûª; stratum II); Bm. ‰Ûª20‰ÛÓ1,4o3 (sq. 18-26‰Ûª; stratum II); Sk. ‰Ûª30-22 (sq. 19-87‰Ûª; stratum VI) and Sk. ‰Ûª195933 (sq. 59-114‰Ûª; stratum II; Block D‰Ûª; deposit E). 506 STONE OBJECTS [CH. 25 1 Prof. Baker‰Ûªs conclusion, as already indicated, was that the porcelain-agate was a natural substance produced, possibly in a volcanic region, by the long‰ÛÓcontinued heating of ordinary quartz. Whence it came, however, is not known. Cf. A.S.R. (1920‰ÛÓ21), pp. 45‰ÛÓ6. l 139. Other stones that are also used, but at a later date, for the same kind of disks or , roundels for inlay and incrusted work, are veined agate, rock-crystal and jade. Most of the specimens of these that we possess come from the jeweller‰Ûªs store-jar found in Deposit E j of Block D‰Ûª (Sk. ‰Ûª19‰ÛÓ933, stratum II) and belong to the Parthian period.I 3 Some specimens of the agate pieces are illustrated in Pl. 147, h, j‰ÛÓm, 0, p. All are plano- i convex, the round disks being from 1-37 to 1-62 in. in diameter, the amygdaloid piece 2-62 in. g in length. Dating as they do from the •Ârst century A.D., these specimens of agate are interesting g in connexion with Pliny‰Ûªs description of the myrrhiua vasa, since they illustrate precisely what he means when he says that some of them contain crystals and depressed spots that look like i warts.2 Of the rock-crystal pieces, one is round (diam. I-62 in.) and two oval (length 0å¡93 and l 1-37 in. respectively). Since rock‰ÛÓcrystal was transparent and colourless, it is probable that silver or gold foil was put at the back of the crystal, just as silver foil was put at the back of carbuncles to enhance their brilliancy.

Comparing these calculated •Âgures with the individual weights, we see that, out of the last eighteen items in the series, there are only two whose weight exceeds the •Âgure calculated, viz. nos. 17 and 24, the former being 6 gr. in excess of 424 and the latter 3 gr. in excess of 106. This is a very slight error when we consider the great irregularities in the weights of coins belonging to one and the same issue, and the di•Âiculty of determining exact weights with the kind of scales or other instruments which were then available. Moreover, it is to be noticed that these two are among the weights which have no cavities in them, and it is quite possible, therefore, that they had not passed the of•Âcial test. So far, then, the sequence of ratios is clear; but the remaining items of the list, viz. nos. 1‰ÛÓ7, offer more dif•Âculty. Taking no. 7 •Ârst, it is to be noted that this weight is a particularly well-preserved one, without chip or cavity, and that there is no allowance, therefore, to be made except for ordinary wear and tear, which with a heavy ball such as this may be put down at, say, 20 or 30 gr. The ratio, then, which this weight evidently represents is the 104th in the series, having a calculated weight of 5,512 gr. tr., as compared with the actual weight of 5,480 gr. tr. or 5,510, CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 511 if we allow 30 gr. for wear and tear. We shall see presently that we have some smaller weights with the ratio 13, and evidently this weight was intended to be a multiple of those, 13 X 8 equalling 104. No. 6, with a weight of 6,030 gr. tr. is also a well-preserved weight, without cavity or chip, and the ratio that it represents is the I 14th with a calculated weight of 6,042 gr. tr. Nos. 5 and 3 are both chipped, the loss in the former being some 40 gr. and in the latter about 5 gr. Seemingly, therefore, these and no. 4 are to be grouped together, the ratio to which they belong being the 1 16th, with a calculated weight of 6,148 gr. tr. There remain nos. I and 2, with weights, respectively, of 6,393 and 6,305 gr. tr. The second is chipped and has a cavity, which is only half- •Âlled with lead. For this and the chipping an addition of 50 to 60 gr. may be made. This weight, therefore, may be taken to belong to the 120th ratio group with a calculated weight of 6,360 gr. tr. The other, though 33 gr. in excess, probably belongs to the same group. The whole series, then, of these twenty-•Âve balls from the jeweller‰Ûªs hoard presents the following ratios and weights: (gr. tr.) (gr. tr.) (gr. tr.) 1: 53 16: 848 104:5,512 2: 106 20: 1,060 114:6,042 4:212 32:1,696 116:6,148 8:424 64:3,392 120:6,360 The other twelve weights from Sirkap, which are in a good state of preservation, fall into the same scale but give us three more ratios, viz. 11, 13 and 60. They are as follows: Calculated weight Weight Ratio (gr. tr.) 26. Sk. 729, 4:3,100 60 3,180 27. Sk. 729, b=3,092 60 3,180 28. Sk. 1,679 =3,019 60(?) 3,180 29. Sk. 225, a: 1,686 32 1,696 30.

The same remark applies also to no. 28. No. 34, with a weight of 555 gr., might be in a ratio of 10 or 11, but, whereas in the former case we should have to explain away a surplus of more than 25 gr. over the calculated weight, in the latter a shortage of 28 gr. can easily be accounted for by wear and tear. The remaining ball weights from TaXila, which are too much rubbed or damaged 65‰ÛÓ2 512 STONE OBJECTS [CH. 25 to be taken into the above calculations, are given below.

The latter follow a binary system, like those of Taxila, in the smaller weights and then decimal, the succession of weights being in the ratios I, 2 (% x 8), 4, 8, I6, 32, 64, I60, 200, 320, 640, 1,600. The commonest weight, of the ratio 16 in this series, has a mean calculated value of 211-5 gr. tr.,I which to all intents is identical with the corresponding weight at Taxila of something under 212 gr. Similarly, the fourth in the Indus series has an average weight of 52-87 5 gr., which is only one-eighth of a grain different from the mean calculated average of the corresponding weight at TaXila. It is quite evident, therefore, that these weights had come down from an immemorial antiquity in India‰ÛÓand it is natural to •Ând them employed for the silver kdrshdpana coinage which was current in the third century B.C. throughout the Maurya Empire. The commonest and most widely diffused of these ka'rshdpazzas averaged, under the Mauryas, between 51-5 and 52-5 gr., although good specimens exist as high as 54 and as low as 50 gr.2 It was only in the North-West of India, which had come under Persian in•Ââuence during the rule of the Achaemenids, that a somewhat heavier ka‰Ûªrshdpazza was used, weighing some 56 gr. or more, the purpose of increasing it to this weight being to equate it with the Persian szgloz‰Ûª, two of which would go to three of these heavier kdrshdpazzas.

(Pl. 149, f, g, i, j.) GROUP B. SCULPTURES OF THE INDO-AFGHKN SCHOOL (FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES AD.) The sculptures of the Indo-Afghan School, which are represented by the following examples, fall into certain well‰ÛÓde•Âned categories. In the •Ârst come the •Âgures of the Buddha, which, as we have already seen, retain, generally, the traditional characteristics which distinguished them in the Gandhara School. In the second are the Bodhisattvas, which are generally recognisable at a glance by their elaborate head‰ÛÓdresses and the profusion of their jewellery. To the third category belong the monks, who wear the same robes as their Master but, unlike him, have shaven heads; and along with the monks a few specimens of Brahmanical ascetics. The fourth category comprises a multitude of devas and lay-worshippers, both male and female, who are represented making offerings or doing obeisance to the Blessed One or to the Bodhisattvas. In the •Âfth category is included an equally numerous and varied company of yakshas or genii, which share, with the lions and elephants, the burden of supporting the tiers of the st•Âpa-plinths. These atlantes, as we may rightly call them, since the original conception of them was certainly derived from Greek prototypes, are depicted with an endless variety of grotesque faces and in every kind of writhing and tormented posture. The lions and elephants, as well as the bulls which crown the Persepolitan pilasters, make up the sixth and last category. CH. 26] STUCCO SCULPTURES 521 STUCCO RELIEFS OF MOHBA MORADU. Nos. 30‰ÛÓ8, a. (Cf. ch. 18, pp. 358‰ÛÓ64.) A. Reliefs on the main st•Ââpa. Among the most beautiful sculptures of the Indo- Afghan School, whether of stucco, clay or terra‰ÛÓcotta, are the reliefs already referred to, on the south face of the main st•Âpa at Mohra Moradu. This face was divided by slender pilasters into eight bays, each of which was subsequently adorned with a group of •Âgures, comprising one or more images of the Buddha with attendant Bodhisattvas or devas, while the faces of the pilasters themselves were enriched with two seated •Âgures of the Buddha, one above the other, some enthroned on lotuses, some on simple seats. Of these eight groups the most arresting is the one in the fourth bay from the western end, to which the premier place was evidently given in virtue of its being opposite, or virtually opposite, the central north-south axis of the st•Âpa drum. The group in this bay, nos. 30, 31 (Pls. I50, a, I 5 I), comprised a seated Buddha in the middle with a standing Bodhisattva on either side, two celestial beings (devas) coming out of the background, on each side of the Buddha‰Ûªs head, and two other •Âgures‰ÛÓprobably Bodhisattvas‰ÛÓenthroned on lotuses in the top corners. The image of the Buddha in the centre is seated in the Teaching attitude (s‰Ûªz'kshd‰ÛÓmudra') on a lion-throne (simha‰Û÷sana), in front of which are four miniature •Âgures of lay-worshippers, including perhaps the donor of the group, two on one side of a bowl, two on the other. All the reliefs are coated with a thin slip of •Âne plaster, and there are traces on them of the buff, red and black paints with which such •Âgures seem to have been invariably embellished. The beauty of the group is necessarily much impaired by the damage it has sustained, especially to the head and hands of the central image, but the attendant Bodhisattvas and the deva above the left shoulder of the Buddha give us a splendid conception of what the Indo-Afghan School, at its best, was capable of achieving. In the whole range of Indian sculpture it would be dif•Âcult to point to •Âgures more beautifully conceived or more perfectly executed than these. Observe the Bodhisattva on the right (Pl. 151); how digni•Âed his posture, as he stands slightly inclining towards the central image; how calm his expression; how delicate the modelling of his features. And notice, too, with what consummate skill the sculptor has handled his garments, draping the dhoti ever so lightly and gracefully about his legs, turning the long scarf in stylish folds about his arms, and giving to the whole a delicate suggestion of movement, as if the Bodhisattva were being borne insensibly towards the Buddha. Then turn from this •Âgure and observe the deva above, emerging out of the background. Nothing could be more tender than the attitude of his hands or more gentle than the expression on his face, as he descends from heaven to do homage to the Great Teacher. It is not only that these •Âgures are nobly conceived; they are •Ânished in every detail with exquisite grace and feeling. The draperies merit special notice. Although more formal and stylish than Hellenistic draperies, they exhibit the same technical methods as the latter in the treatment of their folds; that is to say, the mass of the material between the folds is cut away, and the folds themselves left standing out in relief, as they naturally 522 STUCCO SCULPTURES [CH. 26 do in any thin material. Roman sculptors, as is well known, made a practice of cutting away only the narrow folds and leaving the mass of the material between them unchiselled, thereby saving much labour but producing an effect which was not true to nature. Obviously it is much easier to adopt the Greek method when modelling in plaster or clay than when chiselling stone or marble, and, provided that a sculptor is conscientious in his work, it is the method to which, irrespective of tradition, he must inevitably be led, since it is the only one that is correct. But in the case of the Indo-Afghan School, there can be little room for doubt that in this, as in many other features, it inherited the Hellenistic tradition through the Gandhara School. That does not mean, of course, that this phase of art was merely a derivative or later re•Ââexion of Gandhara art. It owed many of its motifs and ideas and much of its hieratic character to that art, but it went far beyond it, both in pure decorative beauty and in the expression of religious sentiment, and in these spheres it established new and far-reaching traditions which profoundly in•Ââuenced the character of the Gupta and later medieval art of India. Compared with the foregoing, the reliefs in the other bays are of little interest. It might have been expected that the groups to the right and left would have been made to balance or at least to correspond in some measure with one another. But this was not the case. The bay on the left, i.e. the third in order from the south-west corner, contains the seated Buddha (no. 32: Pl. I 50, b) in the Teaching attitude, and on each side of him a Bodhisattva seated cross-legged on a lotus, while between them were smaller standing figuresI and other Bodhisattvas and devas above. The group is not unattractive, but it misses altogether the •Âne feeling and masterly handling of the central one. The modelling of the Buddha is less sympathetic, his draperies coarser and more formal, and the two seated Bodhisattvas have none of the dignity and grace that belong to their standing counterparts in the other bay. Their drawing and modelling are weak, their ornaments not so re•Âned, and the countenance of the one on the right (the only countenance preserved) wears an almost fatuous expression. In the second and •Âfth bays (nos. 33, 34=Pl. 152, a, b) the inferiority is still more marked. In each bay there are three seated Buddhas in the attitude of Teaching or of Meditation, and between them stand two Bodhisattvas. None of the •Âgures, either seated or standing, has any pretention to artistic merit, let alone to spiritual beauty; they are merely stock types turned out, as it were, and repeated mechanically at so much a •Âgure, as we shall see presently that thousands of miniature •Âgures were repeated on the smaller st•Âpas. A typical specimen is the standing Bodhisattva on the right hand of panel 34, which is illustrated on a large scale on P1. I 55, 0. Setting it by the side of the corresponding •Âgure of the central group, one can see at once how weak and ill-proportioned it is, the head and feet too big for the rest of the body, the features awry, the expression devoid of meaning, the ornaments and drapery clumsy and overdone.

The plates are curved to •Ât the body and are of different sizes and patterns; some of their edges are straight, others curvilinear, while some are provided With hinges or pierced with small holes for lacing. The plates are so corroded that there is no possibility of separating them, but enough is visible to show that each was made up of several strips of metal, probably hammered together. It is not possible to determine for certain if they were riveted. Rectangular armour plates, either of iron or of lacquered leather, are •Âgured on the skirts of soldiers in certain Gandhara reliefs (cf. Foucher, L‰ÛªArt gre‰Ûªco‰ÛÓbouddhique du Gandhdra, p. 405, •Âgs. 202, 204), but the size and weight of these plates from Sirkap suggests that they served as armour for horses or even for camelsI or elephants, rather than for men. Horses and riders clad in mail or plate armour were from early times a feature of the Persian, Seleucid, Parthian and Sarmatian armies. A horseman with an armoured apron protecting his legs is •Âgured on coins of the Saka satrap, Kharahostes (B.M. Cat. of Greek and Scythic coins of Bactria and India, Pl. XXIII, 6). About the second century AD. the idea was also copied by the Romans, to whom this class of heavy cavalry was known as the cataphracti (KorrÌ©tcppocK'rOI).‰Û÷ Cf. Xenophon, Anab.

HORSE-BRIDLES AND ELEPHANT-GOADS Ancient horse-bits were generally of three kinds, Viz.: (a) the simple plain or jointed sna•Ââ‰Û÷le-bit; (b) the protected snaf•Ââe, with a ring or cheek-bar at each side to prevent the rein slipping into the mouth; (c) the‰Û÷curb-bit, with a curb-chain or strap fastened to the upper ends of the cheek-bars and passing under the horse‰Ûªs lower jaw, while the reins are attached to the lower ends of the cheek-bars.

The bits found at Taxila are of (a) and ([2) types only. They date from the •Ârst century A.D. Arrian says that in the time of Alexander the Great the Indians did not curb their horses with bits like those in use among the Greeks and Kelts, but they •Âtted round the horse‰Ûªs mouth a circular piece of ox-hide studded with iron or brass pricks pointing inwards but not very sharp; and within the horse‰Ûªs mouth they put an iron prong like a skewer, to which the reins were attached, so that when the rider pulled the reins, the prong controlled the horse and the pricks inside the muzzle goaded its mouth, compelling it to obey the reins.I That the Greeks introduced the snaf•Ââe-bit into India is corroborated by the fact that the Sanskrit word for ‰Û÷bit‰Ûª=khalina, is borrowed from the Greek xoOuvÌ©g. The spiked bit is still all too familiar in the North-West, 1 Cf. Arrian, Ind. 16.

A curious type of nail (a) found only in the Bhir Mound and dating from the third to second century B.C. has a broad •Ââat head of varying shape with a small round hole perforated from side to side at the upper edge. The purpose of the hole is not apparent; it might be intended to take a wire or string. Of nails with heads turned over at right angles to the shank (type b) no. 152 is of the third to second century B.C.; no. I 53 of the •Âfth century AD. Nos. 154‰ÛÓ6 with heavy boss heads all come from Sirkap and date from the •Ârst century AD.

Such bosses were more commonly made of copper or bronze than of iron (cf. ‰Û÷ Copper and Bronze‰Ûª, ch. 28, nos. 408‰ÛÓ12). Hooks (nos. 163‰ÛÓ6) are of two types, viz.: (a) a rigid hook driven into the woodwork of the ceiling, for hanging things on; (b) movable hooks used in conjunction with staples as door-fasteners.

The title strategos was inherited by the Sakas and Parthians from the Seleucid Empire. What precisely the title implied is uncertain. In the Cambridge History of India it is translated ‰Û÷commander-in‰ÛÓchief‰Ûª; by others it has been interpreted as the equivalent of satrap. That it implied something more than ‰Û÷commander-in-chief‰Ûª seems probable from the fact that Aspavarma struck coins in his own name as strategos.

The goddess is standing on a lotus(?) pedestal, resting her left elbow on a pillar and her right hand on her hip. Her drapery falls across her thighs, leaving the rest of the body bare.

They take the form of short rods of bone, ivory, copper, bronze or lead, measuring from 3 to 6 in. in length. If required for smearing antimony or kohl round the eyes the rod is slightly clubbed; if required as a toothpick or nail- cleaner, it is pointed; if as an ear-cleaner, it is furnished with a tiny scoop. Some of the rods are clubbed at both ends; others have a club at one end and a point or scoop at the other; others have a point at one end and a scoop at the other. The earliest specimens found at Taxila date from the third, or possibly fourth, century 3.0.; the latest from the •Ârst century AD. In the earliest specimens from the Bhir Mound, bone or ivory is used for the simple clubbed antimony-rod, copper for the antimony-rod and ear-cleaner combined. In the later specimens from Sirkap, bone, ivory, copper, bronze and lead are used for the antimony-rods; bone, ivory and copper for the combination of ear-cleaner and toothpick; and copper only for the combination of antimony-rod and toothpick. The combination of antimony-rod and ear-cleaner has not been found in Sirkap. Antimony-rods or kohl‰ÛÓsticks, as they are sometimes called, were used in Egypt and the West from a very early age, and it is not unlikely that they and the ear-cleaners were introduced at TaXila by the Greeks. The usual Greek word for antimony was G'riuut or o•Âul. Ear-cleaners were called o‰Ûªo'royluois by the Greeks, auriscalpz'um by the Romans. The clubbed antimony-rod was doubtless used also for ordinary painting under the eyes with lamp-black (Ì©‰Ûªto•Ââohos).

(Pl. 200, k.) implements (nos. 69‰ÛÓ81) With two or three exceptions all the bone and ivory stili, like the copper calami, come from Sirkap, and there can be no doubt of their western origin. The stilus was used for writing on wax; the calamus for writing with ink on parchment, birch-bark, etc. The average length of the stili is about 4-5 in., but some are considerably shorter, others considerably longer. Some have a •Âne smooth point, others a ball point. In some, again, the butt is •Ââattened like a chisel for smoothing out the wax; in others it is rounded. The exceptions referred to were found in the Bhir Mound and date from the third or possibly fourth century B.C. One of them, no. 69, looks like one of the CH. 32] BONE AND IVORY OBJECTS 661 rough bone arrow-heads described below (nos.

The four •Ââat sides were marked with the number I (represented by a pip as in the dice of Class XV) opposite to 6, and 3 opposite to 4. ‰Û÷ The numbers 2 and 5 were wanting.

(P1. 204., q.) GROUP E. WEAPONS AND HORSE‰ÛÓBRIDLES The bone and ivory arrow‰ÛÓheads from Taxila are of four types, viz. : (a) roughly shaped and sharpened at both ends. These are the objects which Cunningham took to be ‰Û÷ spillikins ‰Ûª or ‰Û÷ tip-cats ‰Ûª, but they are much too small for the game in question and there can no longer be any doubt that they served as arrow-heads; (b) with smooth circular point and well-de•Âned tang; (c) with a point similar to (b) but with a hollow socket‰ÛÓhole behind for the shaft‰ÛÓtenon; (d) with a trilateral point and hollow socket‰ÛÓhole behind. Type (a) is found in both the Bhir Mound and Sirkap and was in use from the •Âfth or sixth century B.C. to the •Ârst century A.D.; but the earlier Bhir Mound specimens are distinguished from the Sirkap ones by having the point of the arrow-head somewhat better •Ânished than the tang. Types ([2), (c) and (d) are found exclusively in the Bhir Mound and date from the fourth and third centuries B.C. Kautilya (bk. II, ch. 18) mentions arrows tipped with bone or wood as well as with metal, but these bone and ivory arrow-heads from Taxila could hardly have been intended for serious warfare, unless they were poisoned.

Standing female •Âgure in the round of chloritised mica schist, probably dating from the •Ârst century B.C. Height 725 in. The pose is rigidly frontal, with feet front, legs together, and hands on hips. Save for ornaments consisting of anklets, girdle, crossed breast-chain, armlets and bangles, the •Âgure is nude. The hair, which is treated like a wig in front, is taken back from the forehead and falls in a long plait down the back, with a few curls on each shoulder. On the top of the head is a low polos. Beneath the small base is a projecting tenon, evidently intended to •Ât into a socket-hole. In ancient times the statuette was broken into two at the knees, and, in order to repair it, two small holes were drilled between the legs, one above and one below the fracture. The stiff frontal pose and the poles on the head suggest a Caryatid, but the •Âgure is so small that it can hardly have served that purpose. Possibly the sculptor was endeavouring to portray an archaic type, such as that of the ‰Û÷Mother or Earth goddess‰Ûª, which was still being perpetuated at TaXila as late as the •Ârst century A.D., but this is quite problematical.

Standing female •Âgure in the round of pale grey micaceous slate. Height 4-12 in. The •Âgure, which may be that of a donor belonging to a group, wears a sleeved tunic reaching to the feet, and a cloak which appears to be held in place by shoulder-straps passing in front of the shoulders and attached, perhaps, to the belt. The hands are raised in front of the waist and support a tray(?) full of •Ââowers or other offerings. The ornaments worn comprise anklets, bangles and girdle (mekhald). The head, which was made in a separate piece and joined to the body by a tenon and socket, is missing, but two plaits of hair are shown falling over the cloak at the back.

The •Âgure wears a tunic tied by a cord at the waist and reaching to the knees, long shawl or himation, high boots and necklace(?). The high boots suggest that it may represent S•Ârya, the Sun‰ÛÓgod, whose temple is said by Philostratus (Life of Apollom'us, II, 24) to have stood in the city of Sirkap, where the statue was found. Like no. 6, the statue, although free-standing, is treated as much like an alto rilievo as a •Âgure in the round. The right forearm, which was attached by means of a tenon and socket, is missing, and the head is defaced. The hair is arranged in the same wig-like fashion as on no. 4 and other •Âgures of the early Gandhara School.

Bracket of chloritised mica schist in the form of a winged male •Âgure, with hands in front of breast, possibly holding some object. Height 4-7 5 in.

The feet and ankles are missing. Observe the rough heavy character of the modelling and the careless workmanship; also the formal treatment of the folds of the shawl, as in other •Âgures of this period.
