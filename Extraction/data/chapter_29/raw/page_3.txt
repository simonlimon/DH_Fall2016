the same site. Cf. ‘Copper and Bronze’, ch. 28, (no. 289; ‘Pottery’, ch. 23, no. 109; and
‘ Stone Objects’, ch. 25, nos. 39, 40. See A.S.R. (1926), p. 115, no. 12 and P1. XXVII, 10; and, for
the inscriptions, C.I.I. vol. II, pt. I, pp. 99 (4) and P1. XIX—4. (Pls. 187, no. 10; 188, no. 10.)

11. Sk. ’29—1,362/4; Block D’; sq. 62-113’; stratum III. Silver saucer with ﬂat base,
carinated sides and everted rim. Diam. 6-12 in.; weight 2603-7 gr.; on base, concentric
countersunk circles and between them inscription in Kharoshthi: As’pavarmasa strategasa Sa 10.
1. Dra 2.0 2. = ‘Of As’pavarma, the strategos. 11 staters, 2 drachms, 2 obols.’ For the shape,
cf. ‘Pottery’, no. 107. As’pavarma, son of Indravarma, was ‘strategos’ during the reigns of
Azes II and Gondophares. He was succeeded by his ‘nephew’ Sasas, but not in the ofﬁce of
strategos. The title strategos was inherited by the Sakas and Parthians from the Seleucid Empire.
What precisely the title implied is uncertain. In the Cambridge History of India it is translated
‘commander-in—chief’; by others it has been interpreted as the equivalent of satrap. That
it implied something more than ‘commander-in-chief’ seems probable from the fact that
Aspavarma struck coins in his own name as strategos. On the other hand, it is evident that
there was a distinction at TaXila between kshatrapa and strategos. Cf. ch. 2, p. 62 supra. For
deposit D of Block D’, with which this saucer (no. 4) and other articles of gold and silver
were found, see ch. 6, p. 188 supra. (Pl. 187, no. 11.)

12, a—e. Sk. ’26—4,081/25. From the same hoard as no. I ((1.7).). Five circular saucers of
silver with ﬂat bases, slightly concave underneath, and everted sides and lip. Diam. 5-62—
825 in. Cf. p. 157 (24) supra; A.S.R. (1926), p. 114, no. 5, and P1. XXVII, 3. Other silver
saucers of the same type have been found in Sirkap, e.g. no. 12, f= Sk. ’29-1,362/ 5, which
came from the same deposit as no. 11 supra. (Pls. 187, no. 12; 189, no. 12.)

CLASS VI. Rectangular plate on legs (no. I 3)

13. Sk. ’26—4,o81/2o. From the same hoard as no. 1 (q.v.). Rectangular plate of silver, with
curved rim, on four legs, one of which is missing. Size 8-8 x 6-12 in.; weight 5,378 gr. The legs,
like the bases of the goblets, are an alloy of silver and copper, the copper being added probably
to assist the soldering or welding of the metal. On the back is a short inscription in Kharoshthi,
which reads: Mumjukritas(y)a sa 20 dra 1 = ‘(Property) of Mun‘njukrita, 20 staters, 1 drachm.’
Cf. p. I 57 (25) supra; C.I.I. II, pt. I, p. 98 (3) and P1. XIX, 3. For another example of a rect-
angular dish (lanx quadrata), cf. B.M. Cat. of Silver Plate, no. 87, and Odobesco, Le Trésor

de Petrossa, p. 111, ﬁg. 42. (Pls. 187, no. 13; 188, no. 13.)

CLASS VII. Paterae of repoussé and incrusted silver (no. 14, a, b)

14, a, b. Sk. ’19—933/8; Block D’; deposit E; sq. 59-114’; stratum II. Two dishes or
paterae of silver repoussé, once incrusted with gems or paste. Diam. 6-5 in. The repoussé
decoration is disposed in concentric circles—~a small ring in the middle surrounded by pear-
shaped cloisons; then a wreath divided into siX sections, with varying patterns; and round
this, again, a swag border followed by a beaded edging. The incrustation was in the central
ring, the pear-shaped cloisons and the swag border. For the pear-shaped cloisons, see

pp. I88—9 supra. (P13. 187, no. 14; 189, no. 14, a, 1).)
