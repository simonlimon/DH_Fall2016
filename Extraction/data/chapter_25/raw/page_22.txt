CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 505

cross-holes at the thicker end. It was found in Sirkap (Block A; sq. 19-88’; stratum V) and is
referable to the Second century B.C. Tiger-claws and teeth have long had a talismanic value in
the eyes of Indians, and there is a beautiful example of one from the Bhir Mound made of lead

and half-covered with ﬁligree gold. See ‘Jewellery’, ch. 30, no. 80. (P1. 14.2, l.)

136. Sk. ’16—149; Block A; sq. 20- 59'; stratum II. Hexagonal piece of plain rock-crystal
quartz (2-12 in. in length), which was evidently regarded as possessing amuletic value. It is
bound round with a copper band and doubtless intended to be worn round the neck. Cf. p. 145

supra. (Pls. 142, n; 147, f.)
137. Sk. ’29—405; Block C'; sq. 44-87'; stratum III. Similar to the foregoing, but of black

basanite instead of rock-crystal (length 1-37 in.). Cf. p. 193 supra.

CLASS XXIV. Stones for inlay, incrustation, etc. (nos. 138, a— , 139)

Most of the stones comprised in this class were found in the store—jar of Parthian
date described on pp. 188—9 (Deposit E), the contents of which evidently formed
part of a jeweller’s stock—in-trade. Some of the stones were used for ornamental
inlay work in wood, ivory, etc.; others for the eyes or urua‘s of images.

No. 138, a—f. To the former class belong the thin disks of porcelain-agate referred to on
pp. 478—9 above. As there explained, these disks vary in diameter from 2 to 3 in., and in thickness
from O'I to 0-2 in., and are polished only on the upper porcelain-like surface, not on the under-
surface, which resembles opaline chalcedony. They come from the top strata of the Bhir
Mound and from Sirkap, and are referable to the third and second centuries B.C.I Cf. p. 188

supra.

In View of the unusual character of this porcelain-agate, hitherto unknown to
geology, it is desirable to give here the results of the examination made by Prof.
H. B. Baker at the Royal College of Science, South Kensington. An air-dried
sample yielded the following analysis:

%
Silica 98-40
Ferric oxide and alumina 0-99
Lime 0-12
Magnesia 0-05

This corresponds very closely to an analysis of natural quartz, and the micro-
scopic examination made by the Department of Geology points to the same
conclusion, though no specimen of quartz has yet been found in a natural state
which has the same peculiar arrangement of crystals. Prof. Baker endeavoured to
reproduce the material by heating quartz for three months in an electric furnace
to about the highest temperature of a furnace which would have been available in
early times. This, he says, gave an opalescent material, which, however, was not
identical microscopically with the sample of porcelain-agate examined.

The quartz of these disks could not have been fused, since the substance has
a speciﬁc gravity of 2-64, identical with that of natural quartz, compared with 2-38,
the speciﬁc gravity of melted quartz. On fusion in the oxyhydrogen ﬂame a
fragment ﬁrst splits like ordinary quartz, and then fuses.
