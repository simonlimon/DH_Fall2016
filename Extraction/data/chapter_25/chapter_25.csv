The oldest form of quern in India is the slab or saddle-quern, specimens of which have been found among the Chalcolithic ruins of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro (cf. M.I.C. pp. 25, 456—7). Querns of a similar type, dating from the ﬁrst century A.D., occur on the Sirkap site at Taxila, and are still widely used in India as sil or kari stones, though rarely for the grinding of grain. Strange to say, no MT 62 486 STONE OBJECTS . [011. 25 querns of this type have been found in the Bhir Mound settlement, which is anterior to about 200 no The quern then in use was the stool-quern with four legs. For Egyptian stool-querns, cf. Flinders Petrie, Tools and Weapons, Pl. LV, no. Io5—a type which is found in ancient Egypt as early as the IVth Dynasty. The Indian examples are usually decorated with simple designs, which, as time went on, became more and more ornamental. Whether this type of quern was used generally for the grinding of corn is questionable. The ornamental carvings on many of the specimens suggest that they were meant for the grinding of spices, karz', etc., rather than of corn. It is true that the earliest example of the circular grinding-mill found at Taxila is not earlier than the ﬁrst century A.D., but it is quite possible that the grinding of cereals was chieﬂy done at or near the farms where the grain was grown, not in the city. On the other hand, the grinding-mill is found in most of the early medieval monasteries, and this fact, contrasted with its complete absence from any of the earlier settlements, goes far to show that it did not super- sede the quern untilﬁafter the beginning of the Christian era.

In this and the following specimens, the centre hole, through which the grain was introduced, was pierced through the nether as well as the upper millstone, the nether hole being then plugged with wood and furnished with a pivot or spike. In no. 27, the upper stone is convex above, concave underneath, thinning rapidly towards the edge, while the nether is convex above in order to ﬁt with the upper one.

This mill is also made of Taraki grey sandstone and has a slightly bigger diameter (16-62 in.) than no. 27, but it is provided with a socket—hole for one handle only.

29,,,, IV. Mullers (nos. 19—26),,"29. The third grinding-mill illustrated on Pl. 140 is of a heavier type. It comes from the Pippala monastery (Pl. ’21—38) and probably dates from the ﬁfth century AD. In diameter (13 in.) it is smaller than the two preceding examples, but the stones are more ponderous, and it is made of hard dark grey quartzite instead of the softer sandstone. Three other noticeable differences are: ﬁrst, that the surface of the nether-stone is concave (instead of straight, as in no. 28, or convex, as in no. 27); secondly, that crossing the upper stone from side to side is a deep groove into which a stout piece of wood could be ﬁxed horizontally, with a handle projecting on either side; thirdly, that the hole in the nether-stone into which the centre pivot was ﬁxed is not pierced through the entire thickness of the stone but sunk to rather less than half its thickness. (P1. 14.0, m.) Type b. Crushing-mills. This type of mill, which was also introduced at T axila during the Saka-Parthian period, was designed probably for the crushing and grinding of harder substances (e.g. chunam) than ordinary grain. It is made of hard quartzite instead of sandstone ; the diameter is smaller (about I I in. only) ; the nether— stone is conical at the top ; and the upper stone takes the form of a deep heavy cylinder, concave below so as to ﬁt on to the top of the nether-stone, and with a funnel-shaped hole above. Across its top is a deep groove, as in no. 29, to take the wooden handle- piece, the latter being pierced with a hole in its centre into which ﬁtted the iron pivot of the nether-stone.","’21—38, 14.0-m",,,1921

Vessels made of stone are relatively few in the earlier Bhir Mound cities and are restricted to those of simple shapes—mortars (with pestles), dishes, saucers, bowls and cups. The stones used for them are the hard abrz' (lower cretaceous shell lime- stone) and hornblende-gneiss, soft steatite and alabaster, and the semi-precious rock crystal and agate. Of alabaster there is only one example—a saucer of pinkish- white colour, no. 42. Abri and hornblende-gneiss were used during this early period for pestles and mortars; alm' also for cups and bowls; steatite (soapstone) for bowls and dishes; crystal for little toilet-trays; and agate for ornamental bowls, of which there is only one example. These stones were usually turned on the lathe, but sometimes ground down by hand. - Schist, as already indicated, was not introduced at Taxila until after the advent of the Bactrian Greeks (c. 190 B.C.); but from that time onwards this soft stone CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 489 came more and more into vogue, ﬁrst for simple articles like dishes and carved toilet-trays, but later on for a multitude of vessels and sculptures of all sorts. The earliest objects made of this stone are the two lathe—turned dishes nos. 38 and 39, and the two ornamental toilet-trays nos. 62 and 63,. all four of which are referable to the second century B.C. Later on, in the ﬁrst century A.D., we ﬁnd schist being used for vases of many shapes, goblets, caskets, ladles and lamps, besides unguent- bottles and elaborately carved toilet—trays. The three kinds of schist employed for these articles are the common grey schist of Gandhara, and a micaceous and hornblende schist from the same region; quartz mica-schist and the deep green chloritised mica-schist, favoured at this period by the sculptors of the North-West, were not used for household articles. Other soft stones employed during this period were steatite, phyllite, slate, claye stone and alabaster, but so far as Sirkap is concerned, no household objects made of these stones have been found in strata earlier than the Parthian, and even then their use is restricted to a few articles—mainly toilet—trays and caskets. Specimens made of phyllite, slate, claystone and alabaster are very few; those of steatite are not so rare. During the Kushan period phyllite, as we shall see, was to become the favourite stone for sculpture, and other objects were to be made from it as well as from the other soft stones named above, which continued in use up to the early medieval period. With the introduction of schist for household vessels in the second century B.C., hard stones like gneiss and hornblende gradually ceased to be used for this purpose. Apart from pestles and mortars, for which particularly hard Varieties of stone are needed, only one example (no. 43) of a hard stone vessel has been found in Sirkap, and there is reason for believing that this was a survival from one of the earlier settlements. In regard to the use of agate for small bowls, cups, caskets, etc., the fragments of these vases found at Taxila correspond very closely with Pliny’s description of the famous vasa myrrhina, which fetched such big prices at Rome. Pliny alleges that these vases came from Parthia and Carmania, but no importance need be attached to his statement, because, up to the time when the Red Sea route was opened up, the carrying trade between India and the West was exclusively in the hands of the Parthians, and it is hardly likely that the precise provenance of some of the goods - would be known to the Romans.I The manufacture of agate vases is an age-old industry in India, especially in Kathiawar and round about the gulf of Cambay, and there can be little doubt that it was from there that the Parthian merchants exported them to Italy. On the strength of a line of Propertius,2 it has been inferred (e.g. Ramsay and Lanciani, Manual of Roman Antiquities, p. 4.97), that the myrrhine vases must have been some sort of porcelain, but the foci referred to by Propertius were not ordinary kilns but the special trenched kilns in Which it was the Indian practice to roast agates and carnelians in order to bring out their colours. This process of burning agates was fully described by Barbosa as far back as I 517. Cf. Sir G. Watt, Commercial Products of India, p. 561, and Schoff, Periplus, pp. 193—4. ‘ Schoff, Peri lus, .

CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 493 Nearly all the articles under this head belong to the class of round toilet-trays usually divided into two or more compartments and embellished with ﬁgures or scenes sculptured in relief. Besides this impOrtant series of toilet—trays there are a few miniature trays of rock-crystal, emanating from the Bhir Mound, which in all probability were also meant for the toilet table, and a larger tray of hornblende micaceous schist from Sirkap, which was used no doubt for household purposes. Type a. Toilet-trays. The ornamental toilet—trays are made of schist, steatite, indurated claystone, slate or phyllite. Of the thirty-three specimens described below, thirteen are of grey schist, eleven of micaceous schist, ﬁve of steatite, two of indurated claystone, one of slate, and one of phyllite or phyllitic slate. No. 64, which is probably of the Saka period, is of steatite, but with this exception all of pre—Parthian date are of schist. The subjects portrayed in these toilet-trays are not numerous. They comprise the followmg: Subject No. of specimens (1) ‘Satyr and nymph . . . . . . . . . . I (2) Figure reclining on couch attended by femalesI 2 (3) Drinking and dancing scenes . . . . . . . . 2 (4) Pair of ﬁgures (male and female) holding drinking-cups . 5 (5) Lions, leogryphs, winged stag, hippocamps and other ﬁsh-tailed monsters with riders . . . . . . . . . . . 6 (6) Ditto, without riders . . . . . . . . . . I4 (7) Geometric and ﬂoral designs . . . . . . . . 3 Most of these subjects are clearly Hellenistic, and there can be no doubt that this kind of toilet-tray was introduced with Hellenistic culture from the West, where specimens of them have been found, especially in Egypt.2 Local Indian inﬂuence, however, is to be seen in the lotus rosettes or leaves used as a background for many of the reliefs, in the makam-like treatment of some of the sea-monsters, and possibly also in the pairs of ﬁgures holding drinking—cups, though, as to the last, it is perhaps more likely that this motif, so familiar in the early Mathura School, may also have had a Hellenistic origin. In point of style no. 62, which comes from the Graeco-Bactrian city, has a distinctive character of its own, which apart from its place of ﬁnding would justify us in assigning it to the second century B.C. Instead of this tray being divided up, as nearly all the later examples are, into two or more compartments, the two ﬁgures occupy the centre of the ﬁeld and stand out with effective simplicity against the plain background. The ﬁgures themselves are treated almost as if they were in the round, rather than in relief,3 and the modelling of their forms, albeit sketchy, ‘ The same subject is also represented on the lid of the vessel no. 106 infra. 2 E.g. Flinders Petrie, Objects of Daily Use, Pl. XXXIV, nos. 23—31. 3 This characteristic of most Hellenistic relief work is shared also by the reliefs round the abacus of the Asoka capital at Sarnath, which, as I have shown elsewhere, was executed by a Greek or a Perso-Greek artist of the third century B.C. Cf. C.H.I. vol. I, p. 621, and Marshall and Foucher, The Monuments of Sﬁﬁchi, pp. 87, 88. MT 63 494 STONE OBJECTS [CH. 25 is more conscientious than in the later trays. There is a certain distinctiveness, also, about the style of no. 63, which dates probably from the ﬁrst century B.C. and reﬂects the increasing decadence of Hellenistic art under Saka rule. The scene is of course a purely Greek one, and, although the ﬁgures individually are crudely modelled and stiff and wooden in their poses, their composition still reﬂects the older Hellenistic tradition. In no. 65, on the other hand, we recognise the effect of the Graeco— Roman art popularised at Taxila under Parthian rule, with its more crowded ﬁgures, and much greater freedom of composition and drawing; and we are on quite safe ground in referring to the same century (ﬁrst century A.D.) nos. 64, 66 and 76. But, apart from these few specimens, it is diﬂicult to determine the respective ages of these toilet-trays on the strength of their style alone. This difﬁculty arises from the fact that, with the passing of the Bactrian Greeks and coming of the Sakas, Hellenistic art in India rapidly declined, but revived again in the ﬁrst century under the rule of the Parthians, and though in the interim Hellenistic art in Western Asia had to some extent been Romanised and undergone considerable changes in consequence, nevertheless it is often impossible to determine whether a particular example of debased Indo-Hellenistic work was executed before or after the Parthian revival. And this is true not only of these stone carvings but of other branches of art as well. To be sure, the Indianised treatment of the couple in no. 70, so strongly reminiscent of the Mathura School, enables us to relegate this particular piece with conﬁdence to Parthian times, but it is not often that we get such light from the Indian side. Take, for example, nos. 78, 79 and 82. We infer from their ﬁndspots that they probably belong to the Saka period, but from their style alone it would be impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to afﬁrm that they were not strays from the Parthian level above. In regard to Graeco-Roman toilet-trays from Egypt, a paper by Sir John Evans in P706. Soc. Antiq. (13 Feb. 1908) may be consulted, and also Flinders Petrie, Objects of Daily Use, ch. X, pp. 37—9, where he summarises whatever had then (1927) been published about these trays, their types and purpose.",,Sk,2,1916

In the lower register, seven lines sug- gestive of a palniette. On rim, beaded border in low relief. This toilet—tray is referable to the ﬁrst century B.C., when Hellenistic art was becoming barbarised under the rule of the Sakas. Observe that the ﬁgures in this scene are more widely spaced than in the later Parthian reliefs, in this respect being nearer to the Hellenistic tradition, in spite of their stiff and rigid formality. The wig—like treatment of the hair and the wide—open, prominent eyes are peculiarly characteristic of nascent Gandhara sculpture during the late Saka period.

Numbers of vessels of this class have been found in Sirkap and later sites, and, thanks to the fact that they were used not only for toilet purposes but as convenient receptacles for the sacred relics enshrined in stfipas, many of them are still in a perfect state of preservation. Usually they are made of grey or micaceous schist, but not infrequently of steatite; only one specimen is made of phyllite. Similar caskets, almost always of steatite, had been made in other parts of India—notably in Hindustan and Central India—as far back, at least, as the Maurya period and pro- bably much earlier, but not a single specimen has been found in the Bhir Mound. The earliest—belonging to the early Saka period (ﬁrst century B.C.)—comes from the Dharmarajika. The shapes of these caskets are not many. The commonest are globular and slightly squat, like the modern lady’s pulf—box, the division between body and lid being just above the middle; others are cylindrical and tall; others cylindrical and shallow, like the Greek pyxis; others again—and these are smaller in size—have a CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 499 spherical form with a small closely—ﬁtting lid; and there is one—the earliest of all—— which is square, and another which resembles a vase with wide-open mouth.

Four specimens of these singularly interesting stones have been found at Taxila—three in the Bhir Mound and one in the second stratum of ‘ Sirkap, but the style and workmanship of the latter leave‘no room for doubt that it belongs to the same (Maurya) age as the others. The peculiar sanctity with which ring-stones are invested in India is well known and can be traced back to an immemorial age. Large numbers of them, dating from the fourth or third millen- nium B.C. have been unearthed at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa—some no bigger than a ﬁnger-ring, some so large that it takes half a dozen men to lift them; while among famous examples of to-day may be mentioned the Srigundi stone at Malabar Point near Bombay, which is believed to purify those who crawl through it of disease and sickness, and the equally potent one at Satrunjaya, the hole in which is known as muktdwdra=‘door of absolution’—the door which gives happiness to anyone who can creep through it. The idea underlying all these ring-stones is the same: they are regarded as yonis or female symbols of generationI—the idea being that those who pass through them are, as it were, born again, while in the case of the smaller stones of the same class the mere passing of the hand or ﬁnger through them is an act of special virtue. That the same idea attached to the specimens found at Taxila (probably ex‘voto offerings) is evident from the nude ﬁgures of a ‘ goddess of Fertility’ which are engraved with consummate skill inside the central hole, thus indicating in a manner that cannot be mistaken the connexion between them and the female principle.2 It is not unlikely'that the ‘ Fertility goddess ’ here represented may have been identiﬁed with the ‘ Earth goddess ’ Prithivi. The earth itself was conceived of as wheel-shaped in the Rigveda,3 and it is said to be ‘ circular ’ in the Satapatha Brdhmazuz. A disk of terra-cotta bearing an image in relief of a ‘ Fertility goddess ’ was unearthed by me at Bhita in 191 1—12, and is published in my Report for that year.4 It belongs to the Kushan or Early Gupta period and depicts the goddess with legs wide apart and with a lotus (emblem of birth) issuing from her neck in place of her head. A similar plaque was also found at Kosam and is now in the Indian Museum.S With these may be compared a sealing from 1 Cf.

The cult of the yoni, as of the liﬁga, has long been recognised as pre-Aryan in origin, and examples of it might naturally be expected to occur among the antiquities of Harappa and Mohenjo—daro, which there are the strongest reasons for regarding as pre-Aryan. Whether the pre-Aryan ‘ goddess of Fertility ’ afterwards came to be identiﬁed with the Vedic Prithivi and whether it is the latter or the former who is represented on the Taxila ring-stones are questions on which further light is needed.","146-127-a, I46-128",Sk,,1924

To the former class belong the thin disks of porcelain-agate referred to on pp. 478—9 above. As there explained, these disks vary in diameter from 2 to 3 in., and in thickness from O'I to 0-2 in., and are polished only on the upper porcelain-like surface, not on the under- surface, which resembles opaline chalcedony. They come from the top strata of the Bhir Mound and from Sirkap, and are referable to the third and second centuries B.C.I Cf. p. 188 supra. In View of the unusual character of this porcelain-agate, hitherto unknown to geology, it is desirable to give here the results of the examination made by Prof. H. B. Baker at the Royal College of Science, South Kensington. An air-dried sample yielded the following analysis: % Silica 98-40 Ferric oxide and alumina 0-99 Lime 0-12 Magnesia 0-05 This corresponds very closely to an analysis of natural quartz, and the micro- scopic examination made by the Department of Geology points to the same conclusion, though no specimen of quartz has yet been found in a natural state which has the same peculiar arrangement of crystals. Prof. Baker endeavoured to reproduce the material by heating quartz for three months in an electric furnace to about the highest temperature of a furnace which would have been available in early times. This, he says, gave an opalescent material, which, however, was not identical microscopically with the sample of porcelain-agate examined. The quartz of these disks could not have been fused, since the substance has a speciﬁc gravity of 2-64, identical with that of natural quartz, compared with 2-38, the speciﬁc gravity of melted quartz. On fusion in the oxyhydrogen ﬂame a fragment ﬁrst splits like ordinary quartz, and then fuses. 1 Their reference numbers are: Bm. ’19—1 17 (sq. 12-28’; stratum I); Bm. ’21—966 (sq. 34-118’; stratum I); Brn. ’21—1,426 (sq. 27-64’; stratum II); Bm. ’20—1,4o3 (sq. 18-26’; stratum II); Sk. ’30-22 (sq. 19-87’; stratum VI) and Sk. ’195933 (sq. 59-114’; stratum II; Block D’; deposit E). 506 STONE OBJECTS [CH. 25 1 Prof. Baker’s conclusion, as already indicated, was that the porcelain-agate was a natural substance produced, possibly in a volcanic region, by the long—continued heating of ordinary quartz. Whence it came, however, is not known. Cf. A.S.R. (1920—21), pp. 45—6. l 139. Other stones that are also used, but at a later date, for the same kind of disks or , roundels for inlay and incrusted work, are veined agate, rock-crystal and jade. Most of the specimens of these that we possess come from the jeweller’s store-jar found in Deposit E j of Block D’ (Sk. ’19—933, stratum II) and belong to the Parthian period.I 3 Some specimens of the agate pieces are illustrated in Pl. 147, h, j—m, 0, p. All are plano- i convex, the round disks being from 1-37 to 1-62 in. in diameter, the amygdaloid piece 2-62 in. g in length. Dating as they do from the ﬁrst century A.D., these specimens of agate are interesting g in connexion with Pliny’s description of the myrrhiua vasa, since they illustrate precisely what he means when he says that some of them contain crystals and depressed spots that look like i warts.2 Of the rock-crystal pieces, one is round (diam. I-62 in.) and two oval (length 0°93 and l 1-37 in. respectively). Since rock—crystal was transparent and colourless, it is probable that silver or gold foil was put at the back of the crystal, just as silver foil was put at the back of carbuncles to enhance their brilliancy. Of jade, only two pieces have been found, both in the jeweller’s store—jar. One is a flat lenticular piece with a hole in its middle (diam. 1-75 in.), the other a broken disk (length 1-87 in.). A much ﬁner kind of inlay is represented by a number of small bits of turquoise cut into various shapes—hearts, commas, crescents, circles, etc. These turquoise pieces also come i from the same jeweller’s hoard, and were no doubt designed for cloisonné jewellery.

The weights found at Taxila are more than usually valuable, as they are the ﬁrst of their kind to be found in suﬂicient number for us to ﬁx their values with virtual accuracy, as well as the ratios which they bear to one another. These weights are invariably made of a hard stone—granite, hornblende—gneiss, pyroxene, diorite or chert—and are spherical in shape, that being, so far as we know, the usual shape then in vogue in Hindustan and other parts of India. In this respect they differ from the weights in use in prehistoric times, which are usually cubical in form,I 1 Cf. M.I.C. ch. XXIX, p. 589. «.9 CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 509 though, in the case of larger weights, sometimes conical. Why a spherical weight should have been preferred to a cubical or conical one, is not apparent, since it is neither a convenient shape when the weights are being piled together in the scales, nor, on the other hand, would it have stood in the way of dishonesty, if anyone had wished to grind down their weights. Possibly there was some reason with which we are not now acquainted. Apart from their shape, there is another feature of these stone balls that requires particular notice, because it may have to be taken into account when calculating their original weight. Many of them have a small cylindrical hole drilled into their surface, which was probably made when the weights were being ofﬁcially checked, and left hollow, if the weight had to be reduced, or ﬁlled with lead, if it had to be increased. Some of the balls still retain this lead packing in their cavities; in others the cavities are hollow. We must not, however, take it for granted that the cavity was always hollow, since in the course of the ages, the lead may obviously have decayed or fallen out. Nor, on the other hand, must we take it for granted that any given cavity was necessarily intended to be ﬁlled or partly ﬁlled. It may have been made, merely to reduce the weight, when the balls were being ofﬁcially tested, this being the quickest means of achieving that end. In the same way modern iron weights often have circular cavities drilled out of their underside, which are either left hollow or ﬁlled with lead according as the weight has to be reduced or increased. Altogether, some ﬁfty-four spherical weights have been found at TaXila, but of these, two are evidently unﬁnished and eleven have their edges so rubbed or chipped that it is impossible to draw reliable conclusions from them. The remaining thirty- nine all come from Sirkap, twenty-ﬁve from the jeweller’s hoard in Block D’ (Sk. 933/56) ;I seven from another group (Sk. 729); and three from another (Sk. 225). In discussing them I shall deal ﬁrst with the series of twenty-ﬁve from the jeweller’s hoard, since these not only comprise the largest number, but belonging as they did to a jeweller, by whom they would no doubt be used for the weighing of precious metals, they are likely to have been more than usually accurate. . . It needs but a glance at the serial ﬁgures of these weights given below to perceive that the majority of them fall into a regular binary sequence of ratios. Thus, starting from the last and smallest unit no. 25, which is 51-5 gr. tr., the ratios of the last eighteen are, with one exception, as I, 2, 4, 8, I6, 32 and 64. The exception is no. 13, which has aweight of I ,07 5 gr. tr. equivalent to twenty times the smallest unit. Now, eliminating the two weights I6 and 23, which are damaged, and taking the average of the remainder, we ﬁnd that the unit works out at 523 gr. tr. or, allowing for wear and tear, say 53 gr. tr. This is the weight of the standard Indian punch-marked coin known as kdrshdpazta, and also one of the commonest units in the prehistoric weights of the Indus valley. The series of weights, then, should be, 53, 106, 212, 424, 848 (1,060), 1,696, 3,392 gr. tr. It may be that the loss from wear and tear I See vol.

Comparing these calculated ﬁgures with the individual weights, we see that, out of the last eighteen items in the series, there are only two whose weight exceeds the ﬁgure calculated, viz. nos. 17 and 24, the former being 6 gr. in excess of 424 and the latter 3 gr. in excess of 106. This is a very slight error when we consider the great irregularities in the weights of coins belonging to one and the same issue, and the diﬁiculty of determining exact weights with the kind of scales or other instruments which were then available. Moreover, it is to be noticed that these two are among the weights which have no cavities in them, and it is quite possible, therefore, that they had not passed the ofﬁcial test. So far, then, the sequence of ratios is clear; but the remaining items of the list, viz. nos. 1—7, offer more difﬁculty. Taking no. 7 ﬁrst, it is to be noted that this weight is a particularly well-preserved one, without chip or cavity, and that there is no allowance, therefore, to be made except for ordinary wear and tear, which with a heavy ball such as this may be put down at, say, 20 or 30 gr. The ratio, then, which this weight evidently represents is the 104th in the series, having a calculated weight of 5,512 gr. tr., as compared with the actual weight of 5,480 gr. tr. or 5,510, CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 511 if we allow 30 gr. for wear and tear. We shall see presently that we have some smaller weights with the ratio 13, and evidently this weight was intended to be a multiple of those, 13 X 8 equalling 104. No. 6, with a weight of 6,030 gr. tr. is also a well-preserved weight, without cavity or chip, and the ratio that it represents is the I 14th with a calculated weight of 6,042 gr. tr. Nos. 5 and 3 are both chipped, the loss in the former being some 40 gr. and in the latter about 5 gr. Seemingly, therefore, these and no. 4 are to be grouped together, the ratio to which they belong being the 1 16th, with a calculated weight of 6,148 gr. tr. There remain nos. I and 2, with weights, respectively, of 6,393 and 6,305 gr. tr. The second is chipped and has a cavity, which is only half- ﬁlled with lead. For this and the chipping an addition of 50 to 60 gr. may be made. This weight, therefore, may be taken to belong to the 120th ratio group with a calculated weight of 6,360 gr. tr. The other, though 33 gr. in excess, probably belongs to the same group. The whole series, then, of these twenty-ﬁve balls from the jeweller’s hoard presents the following ratios and weights: (gr. tr.) (gr. tr.) (gr. tr.) 1: 53 16: 848 104:5,512 2: 106 20: 1,060 114:6,042 4:212 32:1,696 116:6,148 8:424 64:3,392 120:6,360 The other twelve weights from Sirkap, which are in a good state of preservation, fall into the same scale but give us three more ratios, viz. 11, 13 and 60.

The same remark applies also to no. 28. No. 34, with a weight of 555 gr., might be in a ratio of 10 or 11, but, whereas in the former case we should have to explain away a surplus of more than 25 gr. over the calculated weight, in the latter a shortage of 28 gr. can easily be accounted for by wear and tear.

The latter follow a binary system, like those of Taxila, in the smaller weights and then decimal, the succession of weights being in the ratios I, 2 (% x 8), 4, 8, I6, 32, 64, I60, 200, 320, 640, 1,600. The commonest weight, of the ratio 16 in this series, has a mean calculated value of 211-5 gr. tr.,I which to all intents is identical with the corresponding weight at Taxila of something under 212 gr. Similarly, the fourth in the Indus series has an average weight of 52-87 5 gr., which is only one-eighth of a grain different from the mean calculated average of the corresponding weight at TaXila. It is quite evident, therefore, that these weights had come down from an immemorial antiquity in India—and it is natural to ﬁnd them employed for the silver kdrshdpana coinage which was current in the third century B.C. throughout the Maurya Empire. The commonest and most widely diffused of these ka'rshdpazzas averaged, under the Mauryas, between 51-5 and 52-5 gr., although good specimens exist as high as 54 and as low as 50 gr.2 It was only in the North-West of India, which had come under Persian inﬂuence during the rule of the Achaemenids, that a somewhat heavier ka’rshdpazza was used, weighing some 56 gr. or more, the purpose of increasing it to this weight being to equate it with the Persian szgloz’, two of which would go to three of these heavier kdrshdpazzas.
