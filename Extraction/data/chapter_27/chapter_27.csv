Most interesting of these are the heavy javelins of type (b). The only specimen found in the Bhir Mound has a three-ﬂanged head; two from Sirkap, ﬁrst century A.D., have four—ﬂanged heads. The former may possibly be a stray, but in any case there seems little doubt that these metal javelins were a foreign weapon introduced either by the Bactrian Greeks or, more probably, by the Sakas or Parthians.

Without exception, all the arrow—heads found at Taxila were intended for shafts made of reeds, not of solid wood, and were provided accordingly with long tangs instead of hollow sockets.I But a peculiarity of nearly all the earlier specimens is that there is a considerable length of solid shank intervening between the head and the tang. The explanation of this unusual feature seems to be that this type of arrow—head is a compromise between the socketed and tanged varieties. Whoever its authors may have been, they had evidently been accustomed to socketed piles designed for solid wooden shafts, and when, for some reason or other, reeds were substituted for the solid wood, the old form of pile was retained and a thin tang added behind the shank for insertion into the reed, the shank itself being made solid instead of hollow. Since the reed arrow was in general use among Iranian and Central Asian2 as well as Indian peoples, it is reasonable to infer that these ‘double-tanged’ heads, as we may call them, were an adaptation of a Western socketed type rather than an Eastern one, and, this being so, it seems not improbable that they were introduced at Taxila by the Bactrian Greeks. In support of this surmise it is to be noted-that the earliest specimens come from the uppermost stratum of the Bhir Mound and are therefore contemporary with the advent of the Bactrian Greeks. No iron arrow—heads of any kind have been found in the earlier settlements on this site,3 although they must, of course, have been in use. Apart from their double tang, the arrow-heads from the Bhir Mound belong to ﬁve different types, viz.: (a) ﬂat, with lozenge cross-section; (b) with triangular cross—section; (c) with square cross-section; (d) with rhombic cross-section; (e) barbed. With the exception of (b) all these types recur in the later settlements in Sirkap, but in the Saka-Parthian period (ﬁrst century 3.0. to ﬁrst century A.D.) two new types also make their appearance, viz.: (f) conical, and (g) three—bladed. The older types of arrow-heads also tend to become larger, e.g. nos. 77, 78, 84. In the ﬁfth century AD. an eighth type (h) with four barbed blades was introduced.4 I Indian arrows seem to have been usually made of the s’ara reed, but arrows made of bambu (7mm) and s’aldkd (a hard wood) are also mentioned in Indian literature, e.g. Kautilya, Arthas’ﬁstra, bk. II, ch. 13; Agni Purina, 245, 12. 2 Cf. Excavations at Dura-Europos, 6th season (1932—3), p. 454, and notes 48 and 49; Stein, Innermost Asia, I, pp. 95—6; III, Pls.

The author, however, does not attempt to explain the peculiarity of the type. 4 Ancient Indian literature refers to arrow-heads of many shapes, e.g. ardhacandra (‘half-moon’), kshurapra (with a razor—edge), sz‘wimukha (needle-shaped), vatsa-dzmta (like a calf’s tooth), etc. Cf. }.A.O.S. XIII, pp. 275—81. 548 IRON OBJECTS [011. 27 The three-bladed type (g) seems to have been specially favoured by the Sakas,I to whom its introduction at Taxila was no doubt due. It is noteworthy, however, that many specimens of this three-bladed, as well as of the four-bladed type, have been found along with specimens of (a) and (d) types at the Dharmarajika and other monasteries destroyed by the White Huns in the ﬁfth century AD. It is a reasonable surmise that the former weapons were used by the attacking Huns; the latter, which were traditional at Taxila, by the defending monks, though the three- bladed type, which had long before been introduced by the Sakas, may also have been used by the defenders.

The plates are so corroded that there is no possibility of separating them, but enough is visible to show that each was made up of several strips of metal, probably hammered together. It is not possible to determine for certain if they were riveted. Rectangular armour plates, either of iron or of lacquered leather, are ﬁgured on the skirts of soldiers in certain Gandhara reliefs (cf. Foucher, L’Art gre’co—bouddhique du Gandhdra, p. 405, ﬁgs. 202, 204), but the size and weight of these plates from Sirkap suggests that they served as armour for horses or even for camelsI or elephants, rather than for men. Horses and riders clad in mail or plate armour were from early times a feature of the Persian, Seleucid, Parthian and Sarmatian armies. A horseman with an armoured apron protecting his legs is ﬁgured on coins of the Saka satrap, Kharahostes (B.M. Cat. of Greek and Scythic coins of Bactria and India, Pl. XXIII, 6). About the second century AD. the idea was also copied by the Romans, to whom this class of heavy cavalry was known as the cataphracti (KorrétcppocK'rOI).‘ Cf. Xenophon, Anab.

I The Parthian camelry, which was also heavily armed, may have been copied from the Roman dromedarii.

HORSE-BRIDLES AND ELEPHANT-GOADS Ancient horse-bits were generally of three kinds, Viz.: (a) the simple plain or jointed snaﬂ‘le-bit; (b) the protected snafﬂe, with a ring or cheek-bar at each side to prevent the rein slipping into the mouth; (c) the‘curb-bit, with a curb-chain or strap fastened to the upper ends of the cheek-bars and passing under the horse’s lower jaw, while the reins are attached to the lower ends of the cheek-bars. (Cf. F linders Petrie, Tools and Weapons, pp. 55, 56, and Pls. LXX, LXXI; Ency. Brit. sxv. ‘ Saddlery ’; Dar. et Sag. s11. ‘ Frenum ’.) The bits found at Taxila are of (a) and ([2) types only. They date from the ﬁrst century A.D. Arrian says that in the time of Alexander the Great the Indians did not curb their horses with bits like those in use among the Greeks and Kelts, but they ﬁtted round the horse’s mouth a circular piece of ox-hide studded with iron or brass pricks pointing inwards but not very sharp; and within the horse’s mouth they put an iron prong like a skewer, to which the reins were attached, so that when the rider pulled the reins, the prong controlled the horse and the pricks inside the muzzle goaded its mouth, compelling it to obey the reins.I That the Greeks introduced the snafﬂe-bit into India is corroborated by the fact that the Sanskrit word for ‘bit’=khalina, is borrowed from the Greek xoOuvég. The spiked bit is still all too familiar in the North-West, 1 Cf. Arrian, Ind. 16. Strabo (XV, 66) says: ‘Instead of bridles they use muzzles, which differ little from halters and the lips are perforated with spikes.’ CH. 27] IRON OBJECTS 551 but no examples of it have been found at Taxila.

A curious type of nail (a) found only in the Bhir Mound and dating from the third to second century B.C. has a broad ﬂat head of varying shape with a small round hole perforated from side to side at the upper edge. The purpose of the hole is not apparent; it might be intended to take a wire or string.

The ornamental door-bosses of iron, held in place by a centre nail (nos. 157—62), come partly from strata of the ﬁrst century A.D. in Sirkap, partly from the ﬁfth-century monasteries at Jauliaﬁ and the Dharmarajika. Such bosses were more commonly made of copper or bronze than of iron (cf. ‘ Copper and Bronze’, ch. 28, nos. 408—12). Hooks (nos. 163—6) are of two types, viz.: (a) a rigid hook driven into the woodwork of the ceiling, for hanging things on; (b) movable hooks used in conjunction with staples as door-fasteners.

XXVII, n. GROUP E. AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS The true spade (no. 198) does not make its appearance at TaXila until the ﬁrst century A.D.—about the same time that it makes its appearance in the Roman world—and was then only used for shovelling purposes. For breaking and hoeing the ground the ordinary tool was a socketed hoe or mattock, shaped like the modern krurpi, with the handle set transversely to the blade. The older specimens of these tools from the Bhir Mound (nos. I82—4) have narrow chisel—like blades, and this type continues on into later times; but some of the later specimens of the ﬁrst century A.D. from Sirkap have broader blades, like the English garden hoe. Side by side with the hoe, a chisel-headed spud was also used at TaXila as far back as the third to second centuries B.C. (no. 191 infra). Later on, this tool, like the hoe also, tends to become broader in the blade. It should be noted that the tools which I here class as spuds, to be used with a vertical handle like a Dutch hoe, or spade, are classed by Flinders Petrie as ordinary hoes to be used with a transverse handle (of. Tools and Weapons, Pls. XIX and XX), but inasmuch as the tools described below (nos. 182—90) are unquestionably hoes with transverse handles, it is highly im- probable that nos. 191—5, which are of a totally different pattern, were intended to be used in the same way as hoes.",,Jn,,1916
