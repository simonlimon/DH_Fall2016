CLASS XXXIII. Nails, nail—bosses and hooks (nos. 150—66)

A curious type of nail (a) found only in the Bhir Mound and dating from the
third to second century B.C. has a broad ﬂat head of varying shape with a small
round hole perforated from side to side at the upper edge. The purpose of the
hole is not apparent; it might be intended to take a wire or string. Of nails with
heads turned over at right angles to the shank (type b) no. 152 is of the third to
second century B.C.; no. I 53 of the ﬁfth century AD. Nos. 154—6 with heavy boss
heads all come from Sirkap and date from the ﬁrst century AD. They were prob-
ably used for studding door-fronts but might also have served as beak-irons for
light metal—work. Beak-irons with single spikes, like these, for ﬁxing into a
wooden block, were in use among Roman artiﬁcers (cf. Dar. et Sag. 3.2). ‘ Incus’,
ﬁg. 4037). The ornamental door-bosses of iron, held in place by a centre nail
(nos. 157—62), come partly from strata of the ﬁrst century A.D. in Sirkap, partly
from the ﬁfth-century monasteries at Jauliaﬁ and the Dharmarajika. Such
bosses were more commonly made of copper or bronze than of iron (cf. ‘ Copper
and Bronze’, ch. 28, nos. 408—12). Hooks (nos. 163—6) are of two types, viz.:
(a) a rigid hook driven into the woodwork of the ceiling, for hanging things on;
(b) movable hooks used in conjunction with staples as door-fasteners.

Type a:

150, a, b. Two nails, with ﬂat shanks and broad ﬂat heads projecting to one side of the
shank. At its upper edge the head is perforated from side to side by a small round hole.

Length 487 and 4-45 in. respectively. Third to second century B.C. Bm. ’21—144; sq. 11- 51’;
stratum II. (Pl. 167, no. I50, a, b.)
