CLASS XXXVII. Spades, spuds and hoes (nos. 182—99)

The true spade (no. 198) does not make its appearance at TaXila until the ﬁrst
century A.D.—about the same time that it makes its appearance in the Roman
world—and was then only used for shovelling purposes. For breaking and hoeing
the ground the ordinary tool was a socketed hoe or mattock, shaped like the modern
krurpi, with the handle set transversely to the blade. The older specimens of these
tools from the Bhir Mound (nos. I82—4) have narrow chisel—like blades, and this
type continues on into later times; but some of the later specimens of the ﬁrst
century A.D. from Sirkap have broader blades, like the English garden hoe. Side
by side with the hoe, a chisel-headed spud was also used at TaXila as far back as
the third to second centuries B.C. (no. 191 infra). Later on, this tool, like the hoe
also, tends to become broader in the blade. It should be noted that the tools which
I here class as spuds, to be used with a vertical handle like a Dutch hoe, or spade,
are classed by Flinders Petrie as ordinary hoes to be used with a transverse handle
(of. Tools and Weapons, Pls. XIX and XX), but inasmuch as the tools described below
(nos. 182—90) are unquestionably hoes with transverse handles, it is highly im-
probable that nos. 191—5, which are of a totally different pattern, were intended to
be used in the same way as hoes.

182. Socketed hoe with narrow blade, thinned out and splaying gradually towards the edge.

775 in. Sk. ’27; Trench D172; stratum II. (Pl. 169, no. 189.)
