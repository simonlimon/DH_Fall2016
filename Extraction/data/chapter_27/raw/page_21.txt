Length 7-37 in. First century A.D. The socket in this specimen consists of two narrow ﬂanges .
bent only over the edges of the handle. Sk. ’20—654; Block B'; sq. 33-86’; stratum II. Cf.

Spades 198. Spade, with double rings for socketing handle, and two rings for attachment of cord.
Size 8-12 x 6-37 in. First century A.D. The presence of the two side rings on the face of the
spade is of special interest as showing that the spade was intended to be used by two persons

for shovelling purposes, just as one sees such implements commonly used in India to-day— \
one person holding the handle and pushing, the other holding the cord and pulling. Sk. ’14—

1,604; Block C’; sq. 45-74’; stratum II. (Pls. 169, no. 198; 205, j.)

no. 199).
CLASS XXXVIII. Weeding-f0rks(?) (nos. 200—2)

‘43 but similar implements have been taken for forked arrow-heads for shooting birds
3 and small game. Cf. Flinders Petrie, op. cit. p. 35, and P1. XLI, 167—9. The fork is
provided with a tang which ﬁtted into a wooden handle (or shaft) and was further ,
secured by a nail. Two of them date from the ﬁrst century A.D. The date of the

third is uncertain.
