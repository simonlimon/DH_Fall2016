CH. 33] SHELL OBJECTS 669

The best bit of shell-work yet unearthed at Taxila is the small portrait head in
low relief (no. 42) which was found in a jar along with a number of coins and other
articles referable to the middle of the ﬁrst century AD. Among the few other
miscellaneous articles included in Class III are four small disks or roundels, which
may have served as buttons, and a dipper or ladle, which is unique at Taxila but
of a kind that had been common enough among the Indus people two or three
thousand years earlier.

CLASS I. Uncut shells (nos. 1—15)

I. Scallop shell of striking size and shape, identiﬁed by the Zoological Survey of India as
a Japanese species, either Pecten uobilis Reeve or Pecten crassicostatus Sowerby, most probably
the former. The route by which this interesting specimen found its way in the ﬁrst century A.D.
from the shores of the Paciﬁc Ocean to Taxila was no doubt through Central Asia. First
century A.D. Sk. ’26—2,215/a; sq. Ire-52’; stratum II. Cf. p. 168 (II) supra. (Pl. 202, g.)

2. Xaucus pyrum (Linn.).I Length 5-62 in. A conch shell used especially in the manufacture
of bangles. Bm. ’2o—I,515; sq. 31-34’; stratum III. (P1. 202, b.)

3. Murex (Chicoreus) augulz' erus (Lamk.). Length 7-12 in. Like the preceding example,
this ﬁne-looking shell may have served as a trumpet, but did not lend itself to the manufacture
of bangles. Second century B.C. Sk. ’29—-2,7II; sq. 46-88’; stratum V. (Pl. 202, d.)

4. Arca (Auadara) grauosa (Linn.). Length 262 in. A mother-of—pearl bivalve. First
century B.C. Sk. ’19—452; sq. 62-112’; stratum IV. (Pls. 201, no. 29; 202, e.) This species
occurs throughout the coastal waters of Arabia, India, Malay Archipelago, Japan, China and
Australia.2 It probably found its way to Taxila from the coast of Sind.

5. Pinctada margaritifera (Linn.).

(a) Sk. ’27—560; stratum II. One valve. Diam. 8-31 in. (P1. 202, c.)
(b) Sk. ’933—51 ; stratum II. Similar; broken; length 5-4 in. (P1. 202, f.)
(c) Sk. ’24—270; sq. 34-48’; stratum II. Similar; length 2-75 in.

This is the pearl-oyster of the Ceylon and Tuticorin Pearl Fisheries, but Col. Sewell tells
me that the shells ﬁshed at the present time average about 3-0 in. in diameter.

6. Lamellidens marginalis (Lamk.). One valve. Diam. 3-87 in. Sk. ’22—231; sq. 12-88’;
stratum II. Cf. p. 196 supra. (Pl. 202, i.)

A fresh—water mollusc widely distributed in the rivers of India, Burma and Ceylon, and
valued for its mother-of-pearl. Several specimens of it were found among the prehistoric
remains at Mohenjo-daro. (M.I.C. II, p. 664.)

7. Parreysia favideus (Benson).

(a) Sk. ’29—423; sq. 46‘87’; stratum III. Length 1-87 in. Cf. p. 193 supra. (Pl. 202, j.)
(b) Bm. ’30-28; stratum II. Length 1-4 in. (P1. 202, k.)

Another freshwater mollusc widely distributed throughout Northern India, including the
Indus river and Gangetic system. Also said to have been found in East Cachar, Sylhet and the
Madras Presidency. Several specimens have been found at Mohenjo-daro. (M1 .0. ibid.)

8. Cypraea arabica (Linn.). Sk. ’29—487; stratum II. Length 2- 5 in. (P1. 202, i.)

A common marine species widely distributed in the Persian Gulf, coasts of India, Ceylon,
Burma, New Caledonia and Australia. One specimen was found at Mohenjo-daro. (M .I .C.
II, p. 665.)

9. Erosarz'a turdus (Lamk.). Bm. ’30—43; stratum II. Length r45 in. (P1. 202, u.)

A large cowrie of light purple colour.

1 Previously known as Turbinella pyrum (Linn.).
2 M.I.C. p. 665.
