624 GOLD AND SILVER JEWELLERY [CH. 30

of this is a somewhat broader band of gold ending in two hooks which project beyond the
framework on either side; at the point of projection the base of each hook is enriched with
a small circlet edged with granules. The ornament on this framework consists of a quatrefoil
central ﬂower, with sprays of three small leaves springing from the tips of its four obcordate
petals, and rosettes alternating with them at the corners. Both rosettes and leaves were inlaid
with turquoise paste. The central ﬂower is ﬁnely granulated and further enriched with a
corona of ﬁve obcordate petals also inlaid With turquoise, on which a gold cupid is reposing.
The lower piece consists of an amphora in the centre, and on either side of it an infant Eros
riding on a winged sea-lion, from which hang four plaited chains ending in a pearl and leaf
terminal, with a cluster of granules at the bottom of each leaf. The amphora is of beaded gold
ﬁligrain, with panels of turquoise paste between. It is set upon a three-stepped base, from which
hang ﬁve gold drops with a cluster of four tiny granules on each. The granules are of solid
metal; the larger drops hollow. The cylinder on the top of the amphora has a beaded rim of
gold granules. The winged cupids and sea-monsters appear to have been cast in a mould, and
afterwards chased with a graving tool. The hair of the cupids, which falls on the shoulders in
a natural row of ringlets, is very carefully worked. The wings and ears of the monsters and the
wings of their riders both front and back are inlaid with turquoise, some pieces of which are
missing. First century AD. Sk. ’29—I,5o7/I; Block D’; sq. 64-92’; stratum II. Cf. A.S.R.
(1929), p. 64, no. 50 and P1. XVIII, 2.

and chainwork. Between the points of the petals are globules of gold, and in the centre a
beaded circlet, once ﬁlled with turquoise paste. The outer petals of the ﬂower are embossed
with imitation granules; the inner petals are plain. At the top of the disk is a trefoil ﬂeur-de-lys
with a small ring behind, the cloisons of which were once ﬁlled with paste. From the base
depend ﬁve plaited chains ending in gold beads. First century AD. Sk. ’26—4,081/6; sq. 5847’;
