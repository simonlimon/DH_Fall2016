63o GOLD AND SILVER JEWELLERY [CH. 30

78. Seven pieces of gold belt or girdle of ﬁsh pattern, comprising six groups of three ﬁshes
abreast, and a circular medallion for the clasp. The ﬁshes, which are 137 in. long, are of thin,
stamped gold, hollow within, and united on the underside by thin transverse strips of gold.
Holes are pierced in their mouths and tails for three strings. Pl. 179, no. 79 illustrates the type
of copper matrix on which they were fashioned. The face of the medallion (diam. 137 in.) is
decorated in cloisonné with a heart and leaf stellate design within a beaded border. The hearts
and beading are inlaid with white orthoclase felspar; the centre and leaves with rock-crystal.
Attached to its back are three small rings on one side and a single ring on the other, intended
for uniting the three threads of the belt. First century A.D. Sk. ’26—4,081/9; sq. 5847';
Block D; stratum III. Cf. p. 156, no. 8 supra; A.S.R. (1926), p. 113, nos. 2, 5 and P1. XXVI,

CLASS IV. Amulets and pendants (nos. 80-9 5)

Amulets and pendants have been classed together in this section because it is
impossible in some cases to be sure whether a particular pendant has an amuletic
value or not. That the claw or tooth pendant (no. 80), the swastikas (no. 85), the
pipal leaves (no. 88), the bell (no. 89), and the clubs (nos. 91, 92), were employed
as amulets is beyond question, and it is equally certain that nos. 82—4 were intended
to hold relics or charms of some sort. But it is not so clear whether nos. 86, 87, 90,
93, 94 and 95 were designed as amulets or merely as ornaments. Coins, for example,
or coin impressions, were certainly used as amulets in Roman times and became
very popular during the third century A.D. (e.g. B.M. Cat. of jewellery, nos. 2727,
2735, 2860, 2868—70, 2875, etc.), but whether the same superstition attached to
them in India is doubtful.

80. Claw or tooth amulet. Length 1-12 in. The core is of lead covered, except at the point,
with a thin sheath of gold. On the front side the gold is decorated with a granulated design of
small hexagons enclosed in beaded borders. In the centre of each hexagon is a rosette of
granules. The tooth or claw is pierced transversely by three holes for suspension. Third to
second century B.C. Bm. ’12—20/ 1. For other articles from the same hoard, see no. 71 supra
and p. 111. Cf. A.S.R. (1912), p. 41, no. 2 and P1. XXXIX, d, 2. Amulets of this kind were
fashionable among both Greeks and Romans, being credited with speciﬁc apotropaic and
other powers. Cf. Dar. et Sag. 3.1). ‘Amuletum’, I, p. 254, and for two specimens from Chiusi
of about the third century B.C., cf. B.M. Cat. of jewellery, Pl. XLVII, nos. 2278, 2304. On the
other hand, the tiger tooth or claw was probably prized as an amulet as highly in ancient as
in modern India. (Pl. 191, o.)

81. Gold sheath of tooth—amulet (length 075 in.) decorated on surface with ﬁne ﬁligree
wire in criss-cross pattern. Found in stratum IV, of ﬁfth to sixth century B.C., but may be a
later stray. Bm. ’19—I,858; sq. 1038'. Cf. p. 101 supra.

82. Oblong amulet-case or reliquary of silver (length 0-87 in.), decorated on three sides with
ﬁne granulated designs of ﬂowers and geometric patterns in beaded borders. One side is
pierced with two holes for suspension. Bm. ’12—20; stratum I. For other articles from the
same hoard, see no. 71 above. Cf. A.S.R. (1912), p. 41, no. I and P1. XXXIX, d, 1. (Pl. 191,p.)
