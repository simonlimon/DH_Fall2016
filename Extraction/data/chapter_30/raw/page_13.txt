CLASS V. Brooches (nos. 96—9)

96. Gold repoussé ﬁgure of winged Aphrodite or Psyche. Height 3-31 in. The goddess is
standing on a lotus(?) pedestal, resting her left elbow on a pillar and her right hand on her hip.
Her drapery falls across her thighs, leaving the rest of the body bare. She wears armlets,
bracelets and a crossed breast—band. Her hair is gathered in a knot on the crown of her head,
with curls falling in front over her ears. Behind her shoulders appear two wings, roughly
depicted. The relief, which is of thin plate-gold, was probably fashioned with the help of
a stone or metal matrix, and afterwards ﬁnished with punches and graving tools. The back was
made in a separate piece and soldered to it. Attached to the latter are three small rings, two
behind the wings and one behind the feet. The type appears to go back to an original of the
Praxitelean School (c. 300 B.C.). For the pose, cf. Reinach, Repertoire de la Statuaire gr. et
ram. 11, p. 334, nos. 5, 6; p. 335, nos. 1, 2, 6; IV, p. 201, no. 4, etc.; VI, p. 80, no. 4. For the
crossed breast—band, cf. Winter, Die Antiken T errakotten, III, 2, p. 209, no. 7 et passim;

97. Gold brooch with ﬁgure of winged Aphrodite or Psyche, similar to the preceding but
of coarser workmanship, though the wings of the goddess are slightly more realistic. Height
2.5 in. First century A.D. Sk. ’13—194A/1; Block E; sq. 77-65’; strata I—II. Cf. p. 160, no. I

98. Gold brooch, With ﬁgures of Eros and Psyche in repoussé relief. Height 1-81 in. The
ﬁgures are standing side by side caressing each other, Eros holding Psyche’s breast with his
right hand. The technique is the same as in no. 96, but the workmanship is superior. At the
back are three small rings for attachment, two at the middle and one behind the feet. In the
base are two small holes, one larger than the other, through which the core of lac or mastic
was inserted. For ﬁgures of Eros and Psyche as lovers, cf. Collignon, Monuments relatifs au
mythe de Psyche, pp. 369 ff.; Stephani, Comptes Rendus (1877), p. 160; Pottier et Reinach,
Ne’cropole de Myrina, p. 411; Winter, Die Antiken Terrakotten, 11, 224—32. For a group on a

99. Circular gold medallion brooch, decorated on face with winged Eros reclining(?) on
ﬂowing draperies. Diam. 112 in. The brooch is made of two pieces of sheet-metal joined at
the edges. The relief, which is of rough workmanship, appears to have been fashioned in a
matrix like nos. 96—8. First century A.D. Sk. ’13—194, a/2; Block E; sq. 77-65’; strata I—II.
