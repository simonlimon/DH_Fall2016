CLASS IX. Anklets (nos. 148—65)

Anklets, such as those described below, are a class of ornament essentially
Indian, and it is noteworthy that the decoration which distinguishes these speci-
mens from TaXila is predominantly Indian in character.

148—51. Four hollow double-ringed anklets of silver. Diam. 6-25 in. The anklets are open
in front and provided with a movable socket to cover the aperture. The upper ring is ﬂuted
and further decorated on the upper surface with three lotus cones or bosses. Below each boss,
connecting the two rings together, is a lotus medallion centred with a human bust in relief.
The movable sockets are enriched with a variety of repoussé designs, Viz. on the upper sockets,
a band of full and half-lotus rosettes in diamond-shaped panels, between borders of quatrefoil
ﬂowers and cable edgings; on lower socket, band of tortoises following one another, with leaves
between, and sinuous vine borders. Ornamentation of this kind, characterised by bands of
lotus rosettes, sinuous vine borders, full—blown lotuses centred with human busts, etc., can
readily be paralleled among the sculptures of Sanchi and Bharhat and other reliefs of the Early
Indian School. Some of the motifs (e.g. the vine), which were adopted by that School, were
doubtless of Greek or Western Asiatic origin, having been introduced by the Bactrian Greeks or
still earlier, under Maurya rule, but the character of the art is indisputably Indian. First century
AD. Sk. ’26—4,081/27; Block D; sq. 58-47’; stratum III. Cf. p. 156, no. 13 supra; A.S.R.

152—65. Fourteen single-ring anklets of silver. Diam. 4-75—5- 5 in. The anklets are open in

fragmentary. Same age and ﬁndspot as preceding and nos. 3, 401.71.). Cf. A.S.R. loc. cit. no. 1. 7
