CLASS XVIII. Rattles (nos. 108—18)

The commonest kind of rattle found at Taxila is in the form of a bird, and all
the early rattles from the Bhir Mound site are of this type. Other rattles (from
Sirkap and later sites) take a quasi-human or animal form, or are made to simulate

the pomegranate fruit or vases.
