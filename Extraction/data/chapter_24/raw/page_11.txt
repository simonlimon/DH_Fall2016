bearded and there are traces of a moustache painted in a black pigment. The nose is damaged;
the upper part of the head, left eye and ear are missing. Of coarse clay with red slip. Work-
manship crude. Cf. p. 181 supra. (Pl. 134, no. 54.)

the inner border, four female musicians at the four corners and a dancing girl on either side;
on top, a bhadra-ghata with lotus; below, shell and foliate design. Probably dates from

Such children’s toys as have survived at TaXila are mainly of terra-cotta—that
being the commonest and least destructible of the materials used for them.

These toys comprise: (a) toy carts drawn by a variety of animals—horses, bulls,
rams and birds; ([7) animals running on wheels; (c) animals without carts or wheels;

(d) rattles.

CLASS XV. Toy carts (mricchakatika) (nos. 58—60)

Of these there are only two specimens from the Bhir Mound and one from
Sirkap (nos. 58—60).

58. Bm. ’21—596; sq. 38-9’; stratum II. Terra-cotta chariot with a transverse hole for axle
underneath the body and another hole for the pole in front. Length 3-5 in. Of red terra—cotta.
The form of this light chariot will be clear from the illustration. Cf. ‘Copper and Bronze’,
ch. 28, nos. 390—2 (Pl. 185, 1'). The chariot with sloping sides is western, not Indian (P1. 134,
no. 58). ,

59. Bm. ’24.~538; sq. 32'35’; stratum II. Similar to no. 58. Length 375 in.

60. No toy chariots of the above type have been found in Sirkap. The nearest approach to
them from that site is the light vehicle—a sort of dog-cart, illustrated in P1. 134., no. 60
(Sk. ’28—I,913; Block G’; sq. 114-79’; stratum II). It is furnished with two holes in front for
the shafts and two grooved projections underneath, for the wheel-axle. Length 2 in. Two
wheels from the same site (Sk. 458 and 1,347) have been ﬁtted to it. Cf. pp. ISI, 209 supra.

(Pl. 134, no. 60.)
It is noteworthy that the Wheels of these toy chariots from the Bhir Mound show heavy and
clearly deﬁned hubs and fellies. The wheels from Sirkap show hubs but not raised fellies.
