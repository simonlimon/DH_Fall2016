46o TERRA—GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [011. 24

124. Sk. ’17—514; Block G; sq. 100°58’; stratum II. Similar, but circlets centred with point.

Length 25 in. Cf. p. 168 supra. (Pl. 135, y, 2.)
125. Sk. ’29—3,166; Block 1’; sq. 13'92’; stratum VI. Similar to no. 122, but with 1 opposite

to 4 instead of 3. Length 2- 5 in. (P1. 13 5, y, 4.)

CLASS XXI. Decorative pieces and personal ornaments (nos. 126—45)

126. Sk. ’13—1,331; Block E; sq. 72-51’; stratum III. Terra-cotta pillar with Corinthian
capital and circular moulded base. Height 6-25 in. The shaft is relieved by a moulded band
near its middle and the ﬂutings take the form of eight countersunk panels above and below this
band. The shaft has a circular hole through its middle, and the top of the abacus is relieved by
concentric circles with a ﬁnely moulded contour. Of purple red, ﬁnely levigated, clay. The
horizontal mouldings were turned on the lathe after ﬁring. In this and other respects, the
workmanship is more than usually reﬁned. The pillar dates from about the beginning of the

Christian era. Cf. p. 161, no. 3 supra; A.S.R. (1912), P1. XXIII, c. (P1. 135, hh.)

127. Sk. ’15—348; Block K’; sq. 162-107’; stratum II. Capital of a miniature pillar of
Persepolitan design, composed of four bulls, sitting back to back. Length 3 in. The capital is
pierced with a vertical hole through its centre. The modelling is rough but vigorous; the clay
badly burnt. This capital, which belongs to the Parthian period, furnishes us with an early
example of a motif which was to become a favourite one among the ﬁfth-century stuccos at

Taxila. Cfg’p. 180 supra; A.S.R. (1915), P1. VIII, e. (P1. 135, dd.)

An interesting type of personal ornament, found chieﬂy in the Bhir Mound,
takes the form of a round medallion or bulla of terra-cotta, usually convex on its
outer side and decorated with reliefs. Some specimens are provided with one or
two small holes for attachment, pierced either from back to front or transversely
across the face. Other specimens have no holes at all. In the simpler "kinds the
decoration consists of rosettes or circular beaded mouldings; in the more elaborate
ones the beaded circles are centred with human masks or ﬁgures in relief or with
a geometric design. What purpose these medallions served is uncertain. Possibly
they may have been in the nature of amulets, like the bullae which Roman boys
wore as a protection against the fascination of the evil eye; or they may have been
simple ornaments (possibly some were ear-rings) without any particular talismanic
signiﬁcance. Whether they were of Indian or foreign origin is open to question,
but it is noteworthy that the human masks are characteristically Greek, While the
relief of the lion attacking a bull is certainly not Indian. For imitation jewellery
made of terra—cotta, cf. B.M. Cat. of jewellery, Pl. XLII.
