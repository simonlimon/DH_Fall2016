CH. 24] TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 451

CLASS XIII. Greek and quasi-Greek ﬁgurines (nos. 45—53)

45. J1. ’13—4; Mound C; 6 ft. below surface. Standing female draped ﬁgure of ﬁne brown
terra—cotta. Height 2-62 in. Face mutilated and legs from knees downwards missing. Arms
atlfull length on either side. Wears long chitén held in by girdle at the waist, necklace and ear-
pendants. This may possibly be the Yavana equivalent of the draped Indian goddess standing
and holding both hands at her sides. The conventional and schematic position of the arms
and hands suggests that this was intended for a traditional idol, not for a genre ﬁgure.
Cf. p. 224 supra. (Pl. 133, no. 45.)

46. Sk. ’20—51 1; Block A’; sq. 2 584’; stratum III. Female head of red terra-cotta. Height
2-37 in. Wears wreath and head band, with rosettes above ears and high coiffure behind. Small
air-vent on top of head. The style is strikingly Hellenistic, like that of many terra-cotta heads
from the mound of Akra near Bannu. Cf. p. 195 supra. (Pl. 133, no. 46.)

4.7. Sk. ’26—2,689; Block F; sq. 90'50’; stratum III. Head of female ﬁgurine of buff-coloured
terra—cotta. Height 237 in. Wears openwork net, perhaps of gold or silver, over front of
hair and high bandeau behind, with rosettes above the ears. Good Hellenistic style.
Cf. p. 166 supra. (Pl. 133, no. 47.)

48. Sk. ’28—I,977; Block G’; sq. 107-78’; stratum II. Head of female ﬁgurine of terra-cotta
wearing prominent ear cones and ﬁllet band over curly hair. Height I - 37 in. In good Hellenistic
style. The cones at the sides of the head call to mind the face-cones of prehistoric ﬁgurines of
the Indus period. Cf. M.I.C. vol. III, Pl. XCV, 26, 27. (Pl. 133, no. 48.)

49. Sk. ’29—2,978; Block A’; sq. 27-92’; stratum V. Head of female ﬁgurine of red terra-
cotta, wearing simple ﬁllet (taem'a) over her curly hair. Height 1- 12 in. Seen in proﬁle, the face
has a very pleasing smile. Cf. p. 127 supra. (Pl. 133, nos. 49 and 49, a.)

50. Dh. ’15—388; mon. court A; 5 ft. below surface. Head of male ﬁgurine with conical
cap. Height I in. Dark red slip. Probably of Parthian date, but Hellenistic in its featuring.
Cf. A.S.R. (1915), p. 10 and p. 278 supra. (Pl. 133, no. 50.)

The two following are Partho-Greek in style.

51. Sk. ’13-—142; Block F; sq. 85-63’; stratum II. Head of male ﬁgurine with conical cap.
Height 175 in. Of same date as the stucco heads from the apsidal temple D, which, like this
head, are of the Parthian period. Cf. ‘Stucco Objects’, ch. 26, nos. 1—22 and p. 166 supra.
(Pl. 134, no. 51.)

52. Sk. ’29—2,693; Block B’; sq. 28'93’; stratum V. Head of male ﬁgurine. Height 2-12 in.
Wears moustache and wreath, with the hair falling on each side over ears. Cf. p. 127 supra
and the small relief of a head in shell of Parthian date, Pl. 208, no. 51 = ‘ Shell Objects’, ch. 33,
no. 42. (Pl. 134 no. 52.)

53. Sk. ’29—2,813; Block C’; sq. 5288’; stratum IV. Head and shoulders of a gorilla-like
ﬁgure belonging to the Simidae family—probably an orang-utan but the identiﬁcation is not
certain enough to admit of inferences being drawn from it. The ﬁgure, which is in the round,
has a wide-open mouth and wrinkled forehead. It is a very ﬁne bit of modelling, probably of
the second century B.C.——too ﬁne to have been an ordinary toy. Traces of white paint on
face, neck and shoulders. Cf. p. 127 supra; A.S.R. (1929—30), p. 91, no. 111 and P1. XIV, 1.
