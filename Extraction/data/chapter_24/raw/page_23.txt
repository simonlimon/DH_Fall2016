In addition to those noticed above, viz. nos. 36, 44, I34 and I 38, a, the following
moulds are of interest:

146. Sk. ’17~772; alongside the city wall; stratum IV. Mould of female ﬁgure, standing.
Height 2-87 in. Hair and veil fall on either side of head. Elaborate head-dress, heavy necklace

and armlets. Of the ﬁrst century B.C. (Pl. 136, l.)
147. Dh. ’15——I,o7o; debris. Terra—cotta mask, perhaps of a Buddha head. Height 3-25 in.

Cf. A.S.R. (1915), Pl. 111, d. (P1. 136, k.)
148. Dh. ’31—10; sq. 1612’; 10 ft. 8 in. below surface. Terra-cotta mould of a female

ﬁgure ornamented and draped. She is standing on a makam and most probably represents

supra. (P1. 136, 11.)

From Sirkap there come also a number of moulds which appear to have been
used by ancient coin-forgers, just as such moulds are used by present-day forgers.
The moulds take the form of ﬂat circular tablets of terra-cotta, with the impress
of half a d0zen or a dozen coins in each, the coins being those of the Saka kings,
Maues and Azes II. The moulds themselves appear to date from the closing years
of the Parthian rule at Taxila, when the kings whose coins are ﬁgured on them
had long since passed away. It is well known, however, and there is abundant
evidence at Taxila itself to show, that these and many other coins, some even older
than the issues of Maues, continued in circulation throughout the Parthian period,
and no doubt the forgers, whoever they were, found it safer to copy the older
issues rather than to forge the current coins of the realm. Cf. A.S.R. (1912—13),
pp. 34—5 and P1. XXX, f. In }.B.O.R.S. (June 1936), vol. XXII, pt. 11, K. P. Jayaswal
expresses the View that some similar moulds found at Rohtak were used in the
government mint, but the impressions of the coins of Maues and Azes II in this
collection from TaXila make it virtually certain that the moulds were part of a
forger’s plant. For similar moulds used for the casting of Roman coins, cf. Num.
Chron. (1871), pp. 28 ff. The following are typical specimens.

149. Sk. ’I4—2,4o6; Block L; sq. 189-71'; stratum II. Fragmentary mould of red terra-
cotta with portions of ﬁve impressions of a coin of Maues exhibiting a caduceus with Greek
legend. Length 3-25 in. Black paint on inner face, perhaps of graphite, which would help
the casting. For the coin, cf. I.M. Cat. I, p. 38 and P1. VIII, I. (Pl. 136, m.)

150. Sk. ’Iz—AI, a. From same spot. Circular mould of light red term—cotta, containing
twelve impressions. Diam. 4 in. Eight of the impressions represent King Azes II on horse-
