Like the largest elephants, only the largest horses have hollow bodies and legs,
and these are very rare. The clay is usually red and well burnt, sometimes with
a grey core, sometimes red throughout. The saddle-horse no. 83 is of buff-
coloured clay with traces of a thin red paint.

The horses on wheels come from the Bhir Mound only. Besides these there are
horses with harness, some with saddles, some without; and one very small
specimen with a rider.

Of the saddled horses illustrated in P1. 13 5, one specimen (no. 83) comes from
the Bhir Mound and one from the Sirkap (no. 87). In the former, the saddle,
which rose high in front and rear, was kept in position by a girth-band passed over
the top, with a breast—band in front and a crupper behind. The latter is a- crudely
fashioned little toy, and all that can be made out of it is that the saddle was four-
peaked, with two peaks in front and two behind, and that it was held with a crupper
behind. Cf. also no. 86, a rather better specimen of the four-peaked saddle.

As a rule, the toy horses from the Bhir Mound are, like the elephants, more

ornamental but less truthfully modelled than those from Sirkap; but whereas the
