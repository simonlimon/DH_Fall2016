CLASS XIX. Whistles (nos. 119—21)

Whistles were made in the form of sling bullets or barrel-shaped beads or
miniature vases with the mouth sealed. In the ﬁrst type there is a hole at each end
and a third hole in the middle of the body; in the two latter types, there are
three holes on one side of the body, one large and two small. No specimens of
whistles have been found in the Bhir Mound site. It looks, therefore, as if they
were a foreign import.

clay, in the shape of a sling bullet, with a hole at either end and a third hole in the middle of

CLASS XX. Playing-dice (nos. 122—5)

Playing-dice of terra-cotta are relatively rare, the materials commonly used
for their manufacture being bone or ivory (cf. ch. 32, pp. 662—3). The only
advantage of terra-cotta was its cheapness. Of whatever material they are made,
the dice are always oblong in shape like the modern Indian dice, never cubical; and
they are marked on the four long sides with the numbers I, 2, 3 and 4.

From the Bhir Mound only one die of terra-cotta has been recovered, viz.:

122. Bm. ’13—159; stratum II. Oblong playing—die of terra-cotta, with the numbers 1, 2, 3
and 4 on consecutive sides, 1 being opposite to 3, and 2 to 4. Of coarse red clay mixed with
lime and sand. Length 25 in. (P1. 13 5, y, 3.)

123. Sk. ’26—1,999; Block H; sq. 121-49’; stratum II. Similar, with small circlets to indicate
numbers, and cross-lines between them. Length 2- 5 in. Cf. p. 169 supra. (P1. 13 5, y, 1.)
