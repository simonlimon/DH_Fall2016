71. In. ’17—1, at. East of stairway of main stﬁpa. This head (height 10-37 in.) has been
reserved to the end because it has a place apart from all other heads on the site. The treatment
of the hair in small ringlets suggests that it may have been meant for a Buddha, but the features
conjure up some Roman portrait. Certainly there is little Indian about it. The exceptional
breadth of the face and lowness of the forehead are noteworthy. The surface, unfortunately,

is much damaged and the back of the head broken. in. Mem. Pl. XXIV, a, p. 44, no. 35.
