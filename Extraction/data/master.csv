42,,,, V. Architectural fragments (nos. 24Š—”9),,"42. In. Š—ÈI7~F 589; east face of st´Œpa A11. Height 23 in. Stucco image of the Bodhisattva Maitreya, in the attitude of Meditation, holding an unguent-´Œäask in the ´Œngers of his left hand. Wears ear-pendants, necklaces and bangles. The state of preservation is excellent, but the modelling is mechanical and the features heavy and soulless. As a rule, Maitreya is seated in European fashion, and is seldom portrayed in the dhyana-mua'ra. Cf. p. 373 supra. (Pl. 1 5 5, d.) B. Small sculptures in situ. Nos. 43Š—”8 (cf. ch. 20, pp. 372Š—”3). These are found on a large class of st´Œpas at Iaulia´Œ and elsewhere. The st´Œpas commonly have a square base, circular drum, dome and a range of umbrellas, but from most of them the superŠ—” structure has now perished and the bases only remain. The latter are generally divided into three horizontal tiers, diminishing in width and height as they ascend, and divided one from the other by dentil cornices. The principle of decoration is the same for all three tiers; it consists of a series of stunted pilasters with shallow niches between them. In the two lower tiers the pilasters are usually in the debased Corinthian style; in the uppermost, in the debased Persepolitan. The niches are in the form either of a trefoil arch or of a portal with sloping jambs, which was the form in fashion at this time for the doorways of monastery cells. These two forms of niches alternate with one another on the faces of the st´Œpas, both horizontally and verti- cally. Within the niches are seated Buddhas or BodhisattvasŠ—”the former in the attitude either of Meditation or of Teaching; on either side of the niches, between them and the pilasters, are pairs of ´Œgures bringing offerings to or worshipping the Buddha. In order to increase the height of the two lower tiers without diminishing the number of niches, an extra row of ´Œgures was added at their base. Inthe lowest tiers these ´Œgures commonly consisted of the forefronts of lions alternating with atlantes, which are shown supporting the weight of the superstructure above them. In the second tier the lions were frequently replaced by elephants. CH. 26] STUCCO SCULPTURES 525 To the above description it should be added that: (a) In the second and top tiers the forefronts of lions and elephants were sometimes added at the base of the portal jambs and trefoil arches which enclosed the niches. (b) The Perse- politan pilasterŠ—”capitals were usually crowned with bulls, back to back. (0) The atlantes generally took the form of warriors or musicians or ´Œgures holding wineŠ—” cups. (d) The ´Œgures beside the Buddha rest, as a rule, on a kind of lotus stool. Sometimes they are two Buddhas, seated and meditating; sometimes they are two monks or two lay-worshippers, kneeling and praying or bringing offerings of fruit or ´Œäowers in their robes or in a basket, or occasionally with caskets in their hands, containing treasures of one kind or another (no. 43=Pl. 156, a). (e) Figures of seated Buddha are sometimes substituted on the face of the Corinthian pilasters in place of the usual small incised panels, e.g. on the pilasters on the west face of st´Œpa D4 (no. 44=Pl. 154, b). The above was the scheme of decoration on the majority of these small st´Œpas, but in some cases it was varied by inserting a row of seated Buddhas or Bodhisattvas side by side and without any adventitious decoration beneath the lowest course of lions and atlantes, as in st´Œpa A11. In a few cases, as in A15, the whole plinth was occupied by such ´Œgures, but as already stated, this may represent an earlier type of decoration. Such intensive repetition of ´Œgures is not found in st´Œpas of the earlier Gandhara School. The new fashion was to some extent the result of the stereotyping and commercialising of art; but it arose still more from the ever-growing practice of repeating the ´Œgures of the Blessed One in countless numbers, so that the donor of them might achieve a corresponding increase in the volume of his merit. The general appearance of these st´Œpa-bases will be clear from the illustrations of st´Œpas A16 and D4 (nos. 45Š—”7) on Pls. 156 and 157. The former, which is the smaller of the two, is now in the local museum; the latter still stands on the spot where it was unearthed. Although the description given above applies accurately to both, there are certain features that merit further attention. One of these is that, while in st´Œpa A 16 all the ´Œgures in the niches are Buddhas seated in the attitude of Teaching or of Contemplation, in theupper section of D4 as well as in D1, Bodhisattvas are substituted for some of the Buddhas. Another noteworthy feature is the sloppy and unconvincing postures of the atlantes, not only on these, but on all the st´Œpas of this period. It is a natural and logical expectation that any supporting ´Œgures of the kind, whether atlantes or caryatids or animals, should be suf´Œciently big and strong to appear to support the super- incumbent weight; but these atlantes are not only absurdly small in proportion to the size of the structure, but they are in attitudes which suggest that, instead of sustaining the mass above them, they are being crushed beneath its burden. A third point of interest is that among the many pairs of attendants on the Buddhas or the Bodhisattvas we encounter here and there some women. One such pair of women occurs in a panel in the lower row on the north face of st´Œpa D4 (no. 48=Pl. 154, c). In the centre, is a meditating Buddha, and to rightŠ—…and left of his trefoil niche a woman seated on a high seat in European fashion. The one to MT 57 Buddhas 526 STUCCO SCULPTURES [CH. 26 the proper right of the Buddha holds in both hands a covered vessel, the bottom of which rests on her left hand, while with her right hand she seems about to lift off the tall lid. The other one holds in her right hand a drinking-cup and in her left a spear. These are distinguishing attributes of Kubera, the dispenser of riches, in his capacity of leader of the yakshas, and later on were transferred to his consort Hariti, the demon mother of children and giver of prosperity. We may be sure, therefore, that these women are meant to be yakshinis, embodying some popular superstition or other.I Hariti herself, so the legend goes, was converted by the Buddha and became an updsikd or lay-disciple; and to feed her 500 children, whom she had formerly fed on the ´Œäesh of human children, Buddha told her that the bhikshus in the monasteries should every day offer her food from their portions. Hence, IŠ—”tsing tells us, an image of Hariti was placed either in the porch or in the corner of the diningŠ—”hall of Indian monasteries, and abundant offerings of food were made to it.z C.

(if. p. 166 supra. Like the largest elephants, only the largest horses have hollow bodies and legs, and these are very rare. The clay is usually red and well burnt, sometimes with a grey core, sometimes red throughout. The saddle-horse no. 83 is of buff- coloured clay with traces of a thin red paint. The horses on wheels come from the Bhir Mound only. Besides these there are horses with harness, some with saddles, some without; and one very small specimen with a rider. Of the saddled horses illustrated in P1. 13 5, one specimen (no. 83) comes from the Bhir Mound and one from the Sirkap (no. 87). In the former, the saddle, which rose high in front and rear, was kept in position by a girth-band passed over the top, with a breastŠ—”band in front and a crupper behind. The latter is a- crudely fashioned little toy, and all that can be made out of it is that the saddle was four- peaked, with two peaks in front and two behind, and that it was held with a crupper behind. Cf. also no. 86, a rather better specimen of the four-peaked saddle. As a rule, the toy horses from the Bhir Mound are, like the elephants, more ornamental but less truthfully modelled than those from Sirkap; but whereas the 58-2 Horses 456 TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [CH. 24 elephant was the more favourite toy in the Maurya period at Taxila, the horse was more fashionable under the Greeks, Sakas and Parthians. In the Bhir Mound examples, the headŠ—”stalls are composed, like the Indian headŠ—”stalls of this period in Hindustan and Central India, of vertical cheek-straps and faceŠ—”strap with horizontal front- and noseŠ—”bands, and sometimes an extra strap between the front- and noseŠ—”bands. Thus, in these early examples, the straps making up the headŠ—”stall were either vertical or horizontal. In the later examples from Sirkap, on the other hand (e.g. nos. 88 and 89), there are usually cross-straps running obliquely from the middle of the faceŠ—”strap to the ends of the bit. At the junction of the straps in both earlier and later types there is commonly a boss, medallion or rosette. For headŠ—”stalls at Si´Œchi, see Maisey, Sd´Œchi and its Remains, Pl. XV, ´Œgs. 14. and 15. In the true Indian harness, plumes were almost invariable, both for riding and driving horses. Even in the toys, plumes are very commonly shown, not only in the earlier specimens from the Bhir Mound but in the later ones from the Greek, Saka and Parthian settlements in Sirkap. Observe that in no. 82Š—”a large hollow toyŠ—”there is a ´Œäy-whisk of loose leather straps hanging from the middle of the front band. In this specimen the eye is formed of a small applied circlet with a hole in the middle. In no. 84 the eye is formed of a round pellet crossed by a straight incision. In the later examples from Sirkap the eyes are twice or thrice as large, and are generally worked up or incised in the body of the clay; in some cases, however, they are applied.

The weights found at Taxila are more than usually valuable, as they are the ´Œrst of their kind to be found in su´Œäicient number for us to ´Œx their values with virtual accuracy, as well as the ratios which they bear to one another. These weights are invariably made of a hard stoneŠ—”granite, hornblendeŠ—”gneiss, pyroxene, diorite or chertŠ—”and are spherical in shape, that being, so far as we know, the usual shape then in vogue in Hindustan and other parts of India. In this respect they differ from the weights in use in prehistoric times, which are usually cubical in form,I 1 Cf. M.I.C. ch. XXIX, p. 589. Îâ.9 CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 509 though, in the case of larger weights, sometimes conical. Why a spherical weight should have been preferred to a cubical or conical one, is not apparent, since it is neither a convenient shape when the weights are being piled together in the scales, nor, on the other hand, would it have stood in the way of dishonesty, if anyone had wished to grind down their weights. Possibly there was some reason with which we are not now acquainted. Apart from their shape, there is another feature of these stone balls that requires particular notice, because it may have to be taken into account when calculating their original weight. Many of them have a small cylindrical hole drilled into their surface, which was probably made when the weights were being of´Œcially checked, and left hollow, if the weight had to be reduced, or ´Œlled with lead, if it had to be increased. Some of the balls still retain this lead packing in their cavities; in others the cavities are hollow. We must not, however, take it for granted that the cavity was always hollow, since in the course of the ages, the lead may obviously have decayed or fallen out. Nor, on the other hand, must we take it for granted that any given cavity was necessarily intended to be ´Œlled or partly ´Œlled. It may have been made, merely to reduce the weight, when the balls were being of´Œcially tested, this being the quickest means of achieving that end. In the same way modern iron weights often have circular cavities drilled out of their underside, which are either left hollow or ´Œlled with lead according as the weight has to be reduced or increased. Altogether, some ´Œfty-four spherical weights have been found at TaXila, but of these, two are evidently un´Œnished and eleven have their edges so rubbed or chipped that it is impossible to draw reliable conclusions from them. The remaining thirty- nine all come from Sirkap, twenty-´Œve from the jewellerŠ—Ès hoard in Block DŠ—È (Sk. 933/56) ;I seven from another group (Sk. 729); and three from another (Sk. 225). In discussing them I shall deal ´Œrst with the series of twenty-´Œve from the jewellerŠ—Ès hoard, since these not only comprise the largest number, but belonging as they did to a jeweller, by whom they would no doubt be used for the weighing of precious metals, they are likely to have been more than usually accurate. . . It needs but a glance at the serial ´Œgures of these weights given below to perceive that the majority of them fall into a regular binary sequence of ratios. Thus, starting from the last and smallest unit no. 25, which is 51-5 gr. tr., the ratios of the last eighteen are, with one exception, as I, 2, 4, 8, I6, 32 and 64. The exception is no. 13, which has aweight of I ,07 5 gr. tr. equivalent to twenty times the smallest unit. Now, eliminating the two weights I6 and 23, which are damaged, and taking the average of the remainder, we ´Œnd that the unit works out at 523 gr. tr. or, allowing for wear and tear, say 53 gr. tr. This is the weight of the standard Indian punch-marked coin known as kdrshdpazta, and also one of the commonest units in the prehistoric weights of the Indus valley. The series of weights, then, should be, 53, 106, 212, 424, 848 (1,060), 1,696, 3,392 gr. tr. It may be that the loss from wear and tear I See vol.

It is a reasonable surmise that the former weapons were used by the attacking Huns; the latter, which were traditional at Taxila, by the defending monks, though the three- bladed type, which had long before been introduced by the Sakas, may also have been used by the defenders.

How the various ´Œgures described aboveŠ—”Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, lay-worshippers, monks and deedsŠ—”were grouped together on the walls of the st´Œpas or monasteries we have already seen well exempli´Œed in the stucco reliefs at both Mohra Moradu and Jaulia´Œ, but a still more instructive example is provided by a remarkable group at Jaulia´Œ, which was executed in clay and by a lucky chance converted into terra-cotta by a ´Œre which burnt down the monastery. This group occupied a large shallow niche (5 ft. 6 in. x 4 ft. 10-5 in.) in front of cell 29, protected from the weather by the broad veranda which ran round the four sides of the court. In the Îâcentre stands the Buddha, now headless, evidently in the abhaya attitude. To his right is a male ´Œgure of medium size wearing a tunic which reaches to his knees, trousers with buttons for lacing, a clasped and jewelled belt and a pointed cap. Between this ´Œgure and the Buddha is a small female ´Œgure, clad in a long dress and ample shawl; and, to the BuddhaŠ—Ès left, a monk wearing a sarighd´Œä, with his right shoulder bare. Above, to the right and left of the BuddhaŠ—Ès head and shoulders, are two dews, standing on lotuses and looking down towards the Buddha. On the side walls of the niche were two large standing Bodhisattvas, but little of them, unfortunately, has survived. Of the ´Œgures on the back wall of the niche, the monk on the BuddhaŠ—Ès left is probably the abbot of the monastery, while the man wearing the conical cap and tunic is no doubt the donor of the group, and the little woman beside him, his wife. The dress and distinctive bearded face of the donor mark him clearly as a foreigner (mleccha) from the Persian side. Particularly noteworthy are his cap, laced-up trousers (or possibly leggings over the trousers) and the clasped belt which holds in his tunic round the hips. The last-mentioned was probably of gold or silver, either embossed or encrusted with gems. In true oriental fashion, the donorŠ—Ès wife is represented as little more than half his size. Her dress, too, is of interest. It consists apparently of a long tunic like the Greek chit’©n, with a shawl (Indian sari; Greek himation) draped loosely over the left arm and shoulder and round the legs in front, leaving the tunic visible over the upper part of the body. Her ornaments consist of two bangles on each wrist, an armlet on the right arm, a heavy neck- lace, and a lighter girdle (mekhald) round her hips. Her cap appears to be provided with the characteristic Persian cheek-pieces or band which passes beneath the chin, and to be secured with cross straps fastened with a medallion in front and tied at the back of the neck. The dress worn by the celestial dew to the proper right of the Buddha is much the same as that Worn by the woman below, except that the under-tunic is so disposed as to leave the right shoulder bare and that the dewŠ—Ès long wavy curls are uncon´Œned by a cap. A feature of this dew that merits 60-2 Jaulia´Œ (nos. 181Š—”6) Iandiil   472 TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [CH. 24 particular notice is the dreamy expression of the eyes, the lids of which are half-closed, as they almost invariably are in conventional images of the Buddha. The expression is one that from time immemorial had been associated with yoga, and from the yogi type had been transferred to that of the Buddha. Later on, in the early medieval period, it evidently came to be regarded as a characteristic trait of the celestial devas who offered their worship and tribute to the Buddha.

(P1. 153, b.)

Her ornaments consist of a hip girdle (mekhald) with square clasp in front and three rows of beads; a breastŠ—”chain, crossed both front and back; bracelets; armlets; and a narrow taenia across the forehead. The hair is taken back from the forehead and falls in a long plait down the back, with a few curls on the two shoulders. On the crown of the head, at the back, is an ornamental medallion.

AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS The true spade (no. 198) does not make its appearance at TaXila until the ´Œrst century A.D.Š—”about the same time that it makes its appearance in the Roman worldŠ—”and was then only used for shovelling purposes. For breaking and hoeing the ground the ordinary tool was a socketed hoe or mattock, shaped like the modern krurpi, with the handle set transversely to the blade. The older specimens of these tools from the Bhir Mound (nos. I82Š—”4) have narrow chiselŠ—”like blades, and this type continues on into later times; but some of the later specimens of the ´Œrst century A.D. from Sirkap have broader blades, like the English garden hoe. Side by side with the hoe, a chisel-headed spud was also used at TaXila as far back as the third to second centuries B.C. (no. 191 infra). Later on, this tool, like the hoe also, tends to become broader in the blade. It should be noted that the tools which I here class as spuds, to be used with a vertical handle like a Dutch hoe, or spade, are classed by Flinders Petrie as ordinary hoes to be used with a transverse handle (of. Tools and Weapons, Pls. XIX and XX), but inasmuch as the tools described below (nos. 182Š—”90) are unquestionably hoes with transverse handles, it is highly im- probable that nos. 191Š—”5, which are of a totally different pattern, were intended to be used in the same way as hoes.",,Jn,,1916,27

This group occupied a large shallow niche (5 ft. 6 in. x 4 ft. 10-5 in.) in front of cell 29, protected from the weather by the broad veranda which ran round the four sides of the court. In the centre stands the Buddha, now headless, evidently in the abhaya attitude. To his right is a male ´Œgure of medium size wearing a tunic which reaches to his knees, trousers with buttons for lacing, a clasped and jewelled belt and a painted nap. Between this ´Œgure and the Buddha is a small female ´Œgure, clad in a long dress and ampleehawl; and,~totl1e BuddhaŠ—Ès left, a monk wearing a sa´Œghd´Œ, with his right shoulder bare. Abeve, re the right-andleft- of the BuddhaŠ—Ès head and shoulders, are two dews, standing on 10111335 and leaking- down towards the Buddha. 0n the side walls of the niche were two large standing Bodhisattvas, but little of them, unfortunately, has survived. Of the ´Œgures on the back wall of the niche, the monk on the BuddhaŠ—Ès left is probably the abbot of the monastery, while the man wearing the conical cap and tunic is no doubt the donor of the group, and the little woman beside him, his wife. The dress and distinctive bearded face of the donor mark him clearly as a foreigner (mleccha) from the Persian side. Particularly noteworthy are his cap, laced-up trousers (or possibly leggings over the trousers) and the clasped belt which holds in his tunic round the hips. The last-mentioned was probably of gold or silver, either embossed or encrusted with gems. In true oriental fashion, the donorŠ—Ès wife is represented as little more than half his size. Her dress, too, is of interest. It consists apparently of a long tunic like the Greek chit’©n, with a shawl (Indian sari; Greek himation) draped loosely over the left arm and shoulder and round the legs in front, leaving the tunic visible over the upper part of the body. Her ornaments consist of two bangles on each wrist, an armlet on the right arm, a heavy neck- lace, and a lighter girdle (mekhald) round her hips. Her cap appears to be provided with the characteristic Persian cheek-pieces or band which passes beneath the chin, and to be secured with cross straps fastened with a medallion in front and tied at the back of the neck. The dress worn by the celestial dew to the proper right of the Buddha is much the same as that Worn by the woman below, except that the under-tunic is so disposed as to leave the right shoulder bare and that the dewŠ—Ès long wavy curls are uncon´Œned by a cap.

(P1. 164, no. 71.) Without exception, all the arrowŠ—”heads found at Taxila were intended for shafts made of reeds, not of solid wood, and were provided accordingly with long tangs instead of hollow sockets.I But a peculiarity of nearly all the earlier specimens is that there is a considerable length of solid shank intervening between the head and the tang. The explanation of this unusual feature seems to be that this type of arrowŠ—”head is a compromise between the socketed and tanged varieties. Whoever its authors may have been, they had evidently been accustomed to socketed piles designed for solid wooden shafts, and when, for some reason or other, reeds were substituted for the solid wood, the old form of pile was retained and a thin tang added behind the shank for insertion into the reed, the shank itself being made solid instead of hollow. Since the reed arrow was in general use among Iranian and Central Asian2 as well as Indian peoples, it is reasonable to infer that these Š—…double-tangedŠ—È heads, as we may call them, were an adaptation of a Western socketed type rather than an Eastern one, and, this being so, it seems not improbable that they were introduced at Taxila by the Bactrian Greeks. In support of this surmise it is to be noted-that the earliest specimens come from the uppermost stratum of the Bhir Mound and are therefore contemporary with the advent of the Bactrian Greeks. No iron arrowŠ—”heads of any kind have been found in the earlier settlements on this site,3 although they must, of course, have been in use. Apart from their double tang, the arrow-heads from the Bhir Mound belong to ´Œve different types, viz.: (a) ´Œäat, with lozenge cross-section; (b) with triangular crossŠ—”section; (c) with square cross-section; (d) with rhombic cross-section; (e) barbed. With the exception of (b) all these types recur in the later settlements in Sirkap, but in the Saka-Parthian period (´Œrst century 3.0. to ´Œrst century A.D.) two new types also make their appearance, viz.: (f) conical, and (g) threeŠ—”bladed. The older types of arrow-heads also tend to become larger, e.g. nos. 77, 78, 84. In the ´Œfth century AD. an eighth type (h) with four barbed blades was introduced.4 I Indian arrows seem to have been usually made of the sŠ—Èara reed, but arrows made of bambu (7mm) and sŠ—Èaldkd (a hard wood) are also mentioned in Indian literature, e.g. Kautilya, ArthasŠ—È´Œstra, bk.

Elephants Terra-cotta elephants are found in both the Bhir Mound and Sirkap. Some have riders, some not. Some are quite plain, others are provided with trappings, and others, again, are adorned with stamped designs. As a rule, the earlier specimens from the Bhir Mound are more ornamental than the later from Sirkap. No. 72, however, from the Bhir Mound is quite plain, and no. 73 from the same site has only a girth and neck ropes to relieve its plainness, but most of the Bhir Mound specimens are embellished with a variety of small patterned squares or triangles or circles or lozenges stamped on the surface of the head and trunk. One elephant only of this class comes from Sirkap, viz. no. 75, and in this case there is only one stamped device instead of several, and the workmanship has become noticeably cruder. Some effort towards decoration has been made in the case of the Sirkap elephant no. 76, but the ornament consists only of a row of incised circles to indicate the girth, and a group of similar circlets on the head to indicate perhaps the headŠ—”cloth. The few examples of these elephants which carry riders come exclusively from the Bhir Mound, and are easily recognisable from the peculiar way in which the legs and seats of the riders are ´Œäattened against the body of the elephants. Evi- dently the toy-makers from TaXila had much greater di´Œäiculty in giving the riders a natural seat on the backs of these great beasts than the sculptors of Si´Œchi had. Possibly they were not so much at home with the elephant as were their fellow craftsmen of Central India and Hindustan. It is evident, too, that in the preŠ—”Greek period represented on the Bhir Mound these toy elephants were much greater favourites than later on, when the Maurya rule had been replaced by the Yavana. As regards technique, most of the elephants are solid throughout, but a few of the largest ones from the Bhir Mound (e.g. nos. 78 and 79), like some of the largest horses, have hollow bodies and legs. This is for the sake of lightness. Such speciŠ—” mens are not very well modelled nor are they embellished with stamped designs. With few exceptions, the clay is red and well-burnt but without any slip, though in one or two of the better examples a wash has been applied to the surface. Only rarely is the clay grey-black, e.g. in no. 76 and in the miniature elephants nos. 80 and 81. The tusks are of one piece with the rest of the beast, not inserted, as they sometimes are in other parts of India, into sockets.

Cf. p. 284 supra. (P1. 136, 11.) From Sirkap there come also a number of moulds which appear to have been used by ancient coin-forgers, just as such moulds are used by present-day forgers. The moulds take the form of ´Œäat circular tablets of terra-cotta, with the impress of half a d0zen or a dozen coins in each, the coins being those of the Saka kings, Maues and Azes II. The moulds themselves appear to date from the closing years of the Parthian rule at Taxila, when the kings whose coins are ´Œgured on them had long since passed away. It is well known, however, and there is abundant evidence at Taxila itself to show, that these and many other coins, some even older than the issues of Maues, continued in circulation throughout the Parthian period, and no doubt the forgers, whoever they were, found it safer to copy the older issues rather than to forge the current coins of the realm.

Among the many objects of earthenware from the Bhir and Sirkap Mounds it remains only to describe certain small votive or ritual tanks of a kind virtually new to Indian archaeology. These tanks do not number more than ´Œfteen in all, inclusive of fragments, and out of this number four were found, as already stated,Š—… alongside the base of the small st´Œpa in the Parthian palace of Sirkap, where they were still evidently occupying the places where they had originally been dedicated; a ´Œfth was lying loose in the debris near by, and two others were found in the courtŠ—” yard of the st´Œpa in Block A. As there are grounds for believing that these two st´Œpas were Jaina rather than Buddhist structures, and as none of the tanks has been found at any of the innumerable Buddhist st´Œpas at Taxila, it is not unreason- able to surmise that they were particularly connected with Jaina ritual. Earliest type a. In the earliest form represented at Taxila the votive tank consists merely of a round bowl with a number of miniature saucer-shaped lamps round its rim. Three specimens only of this type have been found: two in the Bhir Mound, and one in the lowest stratum of Sirkap. They are assignable to the third and second centuries B.C. In the Bhir Mound examples the rim is not ´Œäattened; in the Sirkap example it is.","136-p, 136-q, 136-1'",Sk,,,24

On one side of the tank is a small shrine with a primitive-looking idol of a goddess either inside or in front of it. In most examples the shrine is placed on the rim of the tank, with two small posts to support its front, and there is a ´Œäight of steps descending from one side of it to the bottom of the tank (nos. 158Š—”9). Generally the idol stands beside the steps about half an inch above the ´Œäoor; but in one example (no. 160) the shrine itself is placed on the ´Œäoor of the tank with the idol inside it. Usually the shrine is in the form of a rectangular chamber, shallow from front to back and with or without a pillar in the middle of the facade. In one example, however (no. 161), which comes from stratum III, the shrine is deeper and proŠ—” vided with a high-pitched roof; and in another still earlier example (no. 163) the tank, which may have been circular, was divided by cross walls into quarters, and a circular shrine was set on the dividing walls at the point of intersection.

MM , m Î<*\,W CH. 24] TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 465 A few other specimens of these votive tanks have also been recovered from among the ruins of Sirkap, for the most part in a fragmentary state; but as they are merely duplicates of the foregoing, it would be super´Œäuous to describe them. The questions that we must now endeavour to answer are, ´Œrst, what was the signi´Œcance and purpose of these interesting tanks, and secondly, how came they to be dedicated at these st´Œpas, whether Jaina or Buddhist? One thing, clear before all else, is that they are intimately connected with the cult of the nude goddess whose shrine and miniature idol stand, in many of the specimens, on one side of the tank. Probably this was the Great Mother-goddess whose cult was ubiquitous in ancient India and went back to immemorial times. It was this same MotherŠ—” goddess, as I have elsewhere shown,I whose terra-cotta images are found at Mohenjo-daro and other sites of the Chalcolithic Age, who appears ´Œgured on the thin gold plate found by the late Dr Bloch in the heart of a prehistoric funeral tumulus at Lauriya Araraj,2 and who is carved in relief on the inner side of certain ringstones of Maurya dateŠ—”themselves possessed of magic properties associated with fertility´Œ Then, another obvious feature of these tanks is that they are symbolical of the four elements and of all creation: of earth, air, ´Œre and water, and of all the beings that live in themŠ—”the earth symbolised by the clay of which the tank is made, the air by the birds, the ´Œre by the lamps, and the water by the aquatic creatures within, as well as by the water itself with which the tank was partly ´Œlled. Such symbolism calls for no recondite explanation, for there is no reason for supposing that it implies anything more than that, in the eyes of the votary, the goddess was supreme over the four elements and all created things contained in them. That, at any rate, is an adequate explanation, beyond which it is hardly necessary to go. We should not forget, however, that tanks have a certain peculiar sanctity of their own in India, partly because they are the familiar adjuncts of countless shrines and temples throughout the length and breadth of the land, partly because of the allŠ—”important part they play in the ceremonial ablutions of the worshippers. An eX-voto, therefore, consisting of a miniature shrine with a tank by its side would be a very natural and appropriate form of offering. But whyŠ—”and this is the second question we have to answerŠ—”should these ritual tanks which appertained to an essentially Hindu cult, have been dedicated at Jaina orŠ—”'Š—”if there is any doubt about them being JainaŠ—”at Buddhist st´Œpas? The answer is to be found in the contamination which has taken place in every religion known to us, and which in the ´Œrst century AD. was affecting Jainism as much as it was affecting Buddhism. However philosophic and abstract in their essence these two religious systems may originally have been, it was inevitable that they should take much of their subsequent colour from the primitive and long- established faiths of the people, and that, as they cast their nets wider and wider among the many nations of India and its varied classes of society, they should I See M.I.C. vol.

Connexion with cult of Mother- goddess Symbolism of the four elements Sanctity of tanks in India Fusion of older cuts with Buddhism and Jainism Connexion of ritual tanks with the dead           466 TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [CH. 24 absorb into themselves many beliefs and concrete cultural practices undreamt of by their founders. In the case of Buddhism it is well known how much current folklore went to the making of the jdtakas, and if we turn to the sculptures of Bharhut and Si´ŒchiŠ—”our surest and safest guides to the character of popular Buddhism in the ´Œrst century B.C.Š—”we ´Œnd evidence on every hand of the extent to which the Sakya faith had amalgamated with the cults and superstitions of an earlier age, and become blended with them into the newer Buddhism. Thus we see in these sculptures how Lakshmi, ancient goddess of prosperity and domestic happiness, had been transformed into Maya, the mother of the Blessed One; how the magic Tree of Life and Fortune still continued to shower its blessings on the Buddhists, as it had showered them from time immemorial on their ancestors; and how yakshas and yakshis, ndgas and ndgis played just as real and Vital a part in the new faith as they had done in the old. It can hardly surprise us, therefore, to ´Œnd these little shrines and tanks of the Mother-goddess dedicated by Jaina suppliants at the foot of their st´Œpas. They are only another illustration of the inevitable fusion that was taking place between the primitive cults of preŠ—”Aryan India and a creed which was largely above the heads of the masses. The process is one which can still be seen going on in Burma, where images of the old indigenous Nats are still being set up as guardian genii round many of the Buddhist pagodas, as these small ´Œgures of the Mother-goddess were no doubt meant to protect the Taxila st´Œpas. It may be, too, that this form of votive offering had some special signi´Œcance in connexion with the dead; for the st´Œpa, be it remembered, was in origin a burial tumulus and there is no reason to suppose that its original character was ever lost sight of. I make this suggestion because small tanks of a somewhat similar kind to those we are discussing are still in use in Bengal in connexion with certain rites to Yama, the god of Death,Š—È known as Yama-pukur-bmta. The rites are performed by unmarried girls for four consecutive years and for a full month beginning with the last day of the month Aswin and ending with the last day of Kartik: that is, from the middle of October to the middle of November. The following is the manner of the rites. A tiny tank, about a cubit square with a channel on one side, is dug in the courtyard of the house, and on the eastern side of it are placed plants of rice, banana, turmeric, tulsi,I main,2 kalmi,3 and susm',4 all tied together in a bundle. Then a cowry, a betel nut and a piece of turmeric are placed at each of the four corners of the tank. Next, a number of small ´Œgures are made from the excavated earth, viz. a crocodile, an eel, a tortoise, a shark, sixteen dolls representing washer- men, ´Œshermen and others, and a number of crows, cranes, kites and other birds. Of these, the crocodile, shark, eel and tortoise are placed on the edges of the tank, the two latter near the channel, the birds stuck on little sticks are planted in the middle of the tank, and of the sixteen dolls four are set on each of the banks. Thereafter, an e´Œä'igy of Yama is made lying in his motherŠ—Ès lap, and is placed on the eastern edge beside the bundle of plants; and lastly, lamps are lit at the corners of Š—… Ocimum sanctum. 2 Alocasz'a Indica. 3 Ipomaea aquatica. 4 Mam'lea quadrzfolia.

The girls then proceed to make offerings to Yama and his mother by casting ´Œäowers into the tank and pouring water therein, while they recite certain mantras, bowing down and praying for long life and prosperity for their families and themselves. When the mantras and prayers are ´Œnished, two tales are told by the girls about the powers of the Yama-pukur-brata and the evils that come to those who interfere with the ritual ;I and on the last day of the ceremonies, at the end of the fourth year, the girls give food to Brahmans, and to a cowboy they give an umbrella, a piece of cloth, a pair of shoes, a stick and ten cowry shells. Here, then, in this YamaŠ—”pulsar of Bengal we have all the essential features of the votive tank at Taxila, viz. the square tank of water, the creatures that live in water, the birds of the air, and the lamps of ´Œre, representing in both cases the four elements and all created things over which Yama, no less than the Great Mother-goddess, rules. A curious analogy to these votive tanks of Taxila is also presented by a class of earthenware models found in Egyptian graves of the Middle Empire, two examples of which are illustrated in P1. 136, bb, cc. To Egyptologists they are commonly known as Š—… soulŠ—”houses Š—È, and the former of the two examples illustrated (no. I 36, bb) is doubtless a model of an Egyptian house intended for the soul of the departed.2 The other (cc) is more probably in the nature of an Š—… offeringsŠ—”dishŠ—È, but, with its little lamp in one corner, it can hardly fail to remind us of the tankŠ—”shrines of Taxila, albeit the resemblance may be only a fortuitous one. A closer parallel to the latter is afforded by some votive models which were found a few years ago at Hephaestia in the Isle of Lemnos and described in the Illustrated London News3 by Dr Doro L’©vi. These ex-votos (Pl. 136, aa), which date from the sixth century B.C., consist of a miniature shrine (usually three-chambered) of terra-cotta, with a shallow tank in front, the latter being rectangular or semicircular in plan; and in the tank are various aquatic animalsŠ—”eels, tortoises and the likeŠ—”just as there are in the Taxila tanks. Moreover, in the case of one of the specimens illustrated the resemŠ—” blance is increased by the presence of a ´Œgure seated on the edge of the tank in front of the shrine. That there is any immediate connexion between these tank- shrines from Hephaestia and those from Sirkap is, on the face of it, hardly probable, but it is by no means unlikely that both may go back to a common prototype which in the Chalcolithic Age may well have had a diffusion in the Near and Middle East as wide as the cult of the Great Mother-goddess herself. However this may be, there can be virtually no question that the votive tanks at Taxila were Indian in character. It is true that they occur very rarely in the Bhir Mound, and that such as have been found there are of a different type from those found in Sirkap, I For the brata and the tales told by the girls, see the appendix to this chapter, pp. 473Š—”5. 1 These so-called Š—…soul-housesŠ—È were not known, so far as I am aware, in Roman Egypt.

Against this inference, however, there are two un- answerable arguments. The ´Œrst is that some broken tank-shrines of the same kind were found by the writer as far east as Bhiga near AllahabadŠ—”in the heart of Hindustan, Where the Parthians never penetrated.I The second is that the idols in the tank-shrines were of a type familiar in India from prehistoric times and such as were still, in the ´Œrst century A.D., quite in keeping with popular ideas, but not such as foreign invaders from the West, whether Parthian, Scythian or Greek, are likely to have manufactured. We come now to a class of terraŠ—”cotta and clay ´Œgures which are exclusively . Buddhist in character and altogether more impressive than the preceding examples. In style, they are generally similar to the Buddhist stucco sculptures described in chapter 26, but thanks to the greater plasticity of clay as compared with stucco and to the ease with which it can be handled, many of these ´Œgures show a freedom in their modelling and a sensitiveness to form which was never quite attained in stucco work. With a few rare exceptions, all these ´Œgures belong to the Indo-Afghan School of the fourth to ´Œfth century A.D., and comprise, as we shall see, several pieces of surpassing merit. The smaller ´Œgures were usually of terra-cotta throughout, that is, of clay ´Œred in a kiln.

It is true that the earliest example of the circular grinding-mill found at Taxila is not earlier than the ´Œrst century A.D., but it is quite possible that the grinding of cereals was chie´Œäy done at or near the farms where the grain was grown, not in the city. On the other hand, the grinding-mill is found in most of the early medieval monasteries, and this fact, contrasted with its complete absence from any of the earlier settlements, goes far to show that it did not super- sede the quern until´Œafter the beginning of the Christian era.

Vessels made of stone are relatively few in the earlier Bhir Mound cities and are restricted to those of simple shapesŠ—”mortars (with pestles), dishes, saucers, bowls and cups. The stones used for them are the hard abrz' (lower cretaceous shell lime- stone) and hornblende-gneiss, soft steatite and alabaster, and the semi-precious rock crystal and agate. Of alabaster there is only one exampleŠ—”a saucer of pinkish- white colour, no. 42. Abri and hornblende-gneiss were used during this early period for pestles and mortars; alm' also for cups and bowls; steatite (soapstone) for bowls and dishes; crystal for little toilet-trays; and agate for ornamental bowls, of which there is only one example. These stones were usually turned on the lathe, but sometimes ground down by hand. - Schist, as already indicated, was not introduced at Taxila until after the advent of the Bactrian Greeks (c. 190 B.C.); but from that time onwards this soft stone CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 489 came more and more into vogue, ´Œrst for simple articles like dishes and carved toilet-trays, but later on for a multitude of vessels and sculptures of all sorts. The earliest objects made of this stone are the two latheŠ—”turned dishes nos. 38 and 39, and the two ornamental toilet-trays nos. 62 and 63,. all four of which are referable to the second century B.C. Later on, in the ´Œrst century A.D., we ´Œnd schist being used for vases of many shapes, goblets, caskets, ladles and lamps, besides unguent- bottles and elaborately carved toiletŠ—”trays. The three kinds of schist employed for these articles are the common grey schist of Gandhara, and a micaceous and hornblende schist from the same region; quartz mica-schist and the deep green chloritised mica-schist, favoured at this period by the sculptors of the North-West, were not used for household articles. Other soft stones employed during this period were steatite, phyllite, slate, claye stone and alabaster, but so far as Sirkap is concerned, no household objects made of these stones have been found in strata earlier than the Parthian, and even then their use is restricted to a few articlesŠ—”mainly toiletŠ—”trays and caskets. Specimens made of phyllite, slate, claystone and alabaster are very few; those of steatite are not so rare. During the Kushan period phyllite, as we shall see, was to become the favourite stone for sculpture, and other objects were to be made from it as well as from the other soft stones named above, which continued in use up to the early medieval period. With the introduction of schist for household vessels in the second century B.C., hard stones like gneiss and hornblende gradually ceased to be used for this purpose. Apart from pestles and mortars, for which particularly hard Varieties of stone are needed, only one example (no. 43) of a hard stone vessel has been found in Sirkap, and there is reason for believing that this was a survival from one of the earlier settlements. In regard to the use of agate for small bowls, cups, caskets, etc., the fragments of these vases found at Taxila correspond very closely with PlinyŠ—Ès description of the famous vasa myrrhina, which fetched such big prices at Rome. Pliny alleges that these vases came from Parthia and Carmania, but no importance need be attached to his statement, because, up to the time when the Red Sea route was opened up, the carrying trade between India and the West was exclusively in the hands of the Parthians, and it is hardly likely that the precise provenance of some of the goods - would be known to the Romans.I The manufacture of agate vases is an age-old industry in India, especially in Kathiawar and round about the gulf of Cambay, and there can be little doubt that it was from there that the Parthian merchants exported them to Italy. On the strength of a line of Propertius,2 it has been inferred (e.g. Ramsay and Lanciani, Manual of Roman Antiquities, p. 4.97), that the myrrhine vases must have been some sort of porcelain, but the foci referred to by Propertius were not ordinary kilns but the special trenched kilns in Which it was the Indian practice to roast agates and carnelians in order to bring out their colours. This process of burning agates was fully described by Barbosa as far back as I 517. Cf. Sir G. Watt, Commercial Products of India, p. 561, and Schoff, Periplus, pp. 193Š—”4. Š—… Schoff, Peri lus, .

In point of style no. 62, which comes from the Graeco-Bactrian city, has a distinctive character of its own, which apart from its place of ´Œnding would justify us in assigning it to the second century B.C. Instead of this tray being divided up, as nearly all the later examples are, into two or more compartments, the two ´Œgures occupy the centre of the ´Œeld and stand out with effective simplicity against the plain background. The ´Œgures themselves are treated almost as if they were in the round, rather than in relief,3 and the modelling of their forms, albeit sketchy, Š—… The same subject is also represented on the lid of the vessel no. 106 infra. 2 E.g. Flinders Petrie, Objects of Daily Use, Pl. XXXIV, nos. 23Š—”31. 3 This characteristic of most Hellenistic relief work is shared also by the reliefs round the abacus of the Asoka capital at Sarnath, which, as I have shown elsewhere, was executed by a Greek or a Perso-Greek artist of the third century B.C. Cf. C.H.I. vol. I, p. 621, and Marshall and Foucher, The Monuments of S´Œ´Œchi, pp. 87, 88. MT 63 494 STONE OBJECTS [CH. 25 is more conscientious than in the later trays. There is a certain distinctiveness, also, about the style of no. 63, which dates probably from the ´Œrst century B.C. and re´Œäects the increasing decadence of Hellenistic art under Saka rule. The scene is of course a purely Greek one, and, although the ´Œgures individually are crudely modelled and stiff and wooden in their poses, their composition still re´Œäects the older Hellenistic tradition. In no. 65, on the other hand, we recognise the effect of the GraecoŠ—” Roman art popularised at Taxila under Parthian rule, with its more crowded ´Œgures, and much greater freedom of composition and drawing; and we are on quite safe ground in referring to the same century (´Œrst century A.D.) nos. 64, 66 and 76. But, apart from these few specimens, it is di´Œäicult to determine the respective ages of these toilet-trays on the strength of their style alone. This dif´Œculty arises from the fact that, with the passing of the Bactrian Greeks and coming of the Sakas, Hellenistic art in India rapidly declined, but revived again in the ´Œrst century under the rule of the Parthians, and though in the interim Hellenistic art in Western Asia had to some extent been Romanised and undergone considerable changes in consequence, nevertheless it is often impossible to determine whether a particular example of debased Indo-Hellenistic work was executed before or after the Parthian revival. And this is true not only of these stone carvings but of other branches of art as well. To be sure, the Indianised treatment of the couple in no. 70, so strongly reminiscent of the Mathura School, enables us to relegate this particular piece with con´Œdence to Parthian times, but it is not often that we get such light from the Indian side. Take, for example, nos. 78, 79 and 82. We infer from their ´Œndspots that they probably belong to the Saka period, but from their style alone it would be impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to af´Œrm that they were not strays from the Parthian level above. In regard to Graeco-Roman toilet-trays from Egypt, a paper by Sir John Evans in P706. Soc. Antiq. (13 Feb. 1908) may be consulted, and also Flinders Petrie, Objects of Daily Use, ch. X, pp. 37Š—”9, where he summarises whatever had then (1927) been published about these trays, their types and purpose.",,Sk,2,1916,25

The idea underlying all these ring-stones is the same: they are regarded as yonis or female symbols of generationIŠ—”the idea being that those who pass through them are, as it were, born again, while in the case of the smaller stones of the same class the mere passing of the hand or ´Œnger through them is an act of special virtue.

As there explained, these disks vary in diameter from 2 to 3 in., and in thickness from O'I to 0-2 in., and are polished only on the upper porcelain-like surface, not on the under- surface, which resembles opaline chalcedony. They come from the top strata of the Bhir Mound and from Sirkap, and are referable to the third and second centuries B.C.I Cf. p. 188 supra. In View of the unusual character of this porcelain-agate, hitherto unknown to geology, it is desirable to give here the results of the examination made by Prof. H. B. Baker at the Royal College of Science, South Kensington. An air-dried sample yielded the following analysis: % Silica 98-40 Ferric oxide and alumina 0-99 Lime 0-12 Magnesia 0-05 This corresponds very closely to an analysis of natural quartz, and the micro- scopic examination made by the Department of Geology points to the same conclusion, though no specimen of quartz has yet been found in a natural state which has the same peculiar arrangement of crystals. Prof. Baker endeavoured to reproduce the material by heating quartz for three months in an electric furnace to about the highest temperature of a furnace which would have been available in early times. This, he says, gave an opalescent material, which, however, was not identical microscopically with the sample of porcelain-agate examined. The quartz of these disks could not have been fused, since the substance has a speci´Œc gravity of 2-64, identical with that of natural quartz, compared with 2-38, the speci´Œc gravity of melted quartz.

Whence it came, however, is not known. Cf. A.S.R. (1920Š—”21), pp. 45Š—”6. l 139. Other stones that are also used, but at a later date, for the same kind of disks or , roundels for inlay and incrusted work, are veined agate, rock-crystal and jade.

I-62 in.) and two oval (length 0Îç93 and l 1-37 in. respectively). Since rockŠ—”crystal was transparent and colourless, it is probable that silver or gold foil was put at the back of the crystal, just as silver foil was put at the back of carbuncles to enhance their brilliancy. Of jade, only two pieces have been found, both in the jewellerŠ—Ès storeŠ—”jar. One is a flat lenticular piece with a hole in its middle (diam. 1-75 in.), the other a broken disk (length 1-87 in.).

Comparing these calculated ´Œgures with the individual weights, we see that, out of the last eighteen items in the series, there are only two whose weight exceeds the ´Œgure calculated, viz. nos. 17 and 24, the former being 6 gr. in excess of 424 and the latter 3 gr. in excess of 106. This is a very slight error when we consider the great irregularities in the weights of coins belonging to one and the same issue, and the di´Œiculty of determining exact weights with the kind of scales or other instruments which were then available. Moreover, it is to be noticed that these two are among the weights which have no cavities in them, and it is quite possible, therefore, that they had not passed the of´Œcial test. So far, then, the sequence of ratios is clear; but the remaining items of the list, viz. nos. 1Š—”7, offer more dif´Œculty. Taking no. 7 ´Œrst, it is to be noted that this weight is a particularly well-preserved one, without chip or cavity, and that there is no allowance, therefore, to be made except for ordinary wear and tear, which with a heavy ball such as this may be put down at, say, 20 or 30 gr. The ratio, then, which this weight evidently represents is the 104th in the series, having a calculated weight of 5,512 gr. tr., as compared with the actual weight of 5,480 gr. tr. or 5,510, CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 511 if we allow 30 gr. for wear and tear. We shall see presently that we have some smaller weights with the ratio 13, and evidently this weight was intended to be a multiple of those, 13 X 8 equalling 104. No. 6, with a weight of 6,030 gr. tr. is also a well-preserved weight, without cavity or chip, and the ratio that it represents is the I 14th with a calculated weight of 6,042 gr. tr. Nos. 5 and 3 are both chipped, the loss in the former being some 40 gr. and in the latter about 5 gr. Seemingly, therefore, these and no. 4 are to be grouped together, the ratio to which they belong being the 1 16th, with a calculated weight of 6,148 gr. tr. There remain nos. I and 2, with weights, respectively, of 6,393 and 6,305 gr. tr. The second is chipped and has a cavity, which is only half- ´Œlled with lead. For this and the chipping an addition of 50 to 60 gr. may be made. This weight, therefore, may be taken to belong to the 120th ratio group with a calculated weight of 6,360 gr. tr. The other, though 33 gr. in excess, probably belongs to the same group. The whole series, then, of these twenty-´Œve balls from the jewellerŠ—Ès hoard presents the following ratios and weights: (gr. tr.) (gr. tr.)

The same remark applies also to no. 28. No. 34, with a weight of 555 gr., might be in a ratio of 10 or 11, but, whereas in the former case we should have to explain away a surplus of more than 25 gr. over the calculated weight, in the latter a shortage of 28 gr. can easily be accounted for by wear and tear.

The latter follow a binary system, like those of Taxila, in the smaller weights and then decimal, the succession of weights being in the ratios I, 2 (% x 8), 4, 8, I6, 32, 64, I60, 200, 320, 640, 1,600. The commonest weight, of the ratio 16 in this series, has a mean calculated value of 211-5 gr. tr.,I which to all intents is identical with the corresponding weight at Taxila of something under 212 gr. Similarly, the fourth in the Indus series has an average weight of 52-87 5 gr., which is only one-eighth of a grain different from the mean calculated average of the corresponding weight at TaXila. It is quite evident, therefore, that these weights had come down from an immemorial antiquity in IndiaŠ—”and it is natural to ´Œnd them employed for the silver kdrshdpana coinage which was current in the third century B.C. throughout the Maurya Empire. The commonest and most widely diffused of these ka'rshdpazzas averaged, under the Mauryas, between 51-5 and 52-5 gr., although good specimens exist as high as 54 and as low as 50 gr.2 It was only in the North-West of India, which had come under Persian in´Œäuence during the rule of the Achaemenids, that a somewhat heavier kaŠ—Èrshdpazza was used, weighing some 56 gr. or more, the purpose of increasing it to this weight being to equate it with the Persian szglozŠ—È, two of which would go to three of these heavier kdrshdpazzas.

SCULPTURES OF THE INDO-AFGHKN SCHOOL (FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES AD.) The sculptures of the Indo-Afghan School, which are represented by the following examples, fall into certain wellŠ—”de´Œned categories. In the ´Œrst come the ´Œgures of the Buddha, which, as we have already seen, retain, generally, the traditional characteristics which distinguished them in the Gandhara School. In the second are the Bodhisattvas, which are generally recognisable at a glance by their elaborate headŠ—”dresses and the profusion of their jewellery. To the third category belong the monks, who wear the same robes as their Master but, unlike him, have shaven heads; and along with the monks a few specimens of Brahmanical ascetics. The fourth category comprises a multitude of devas and lay-worshippers, both male and female, who are represented making offerings or doing obeisance to the Blessed One or to the Bodhisattvas. In the ´Œfth category is included an equally numerous and varied company of yakshas or genii, which share, with the lions and elephants, the burden of supporting the tiers of the st´Œpa-plinths. These atlantes, as we may rightly call them, since the original conception of them was certainly derived from Greek prototypes, are depicted with an endless variety of grotesque faces and in every kind of writhing and tormented posture. The lions and elephants, as well as the bulls which crown the Persepolitan pilasters, make up the sixth and last category. CH. 26] STUCCO SCULPTURES 521 STUCCO RELIEFS OF MOHBA MORADU. Nos. 30Š—”8, a. (Cf. ch. 18, pp. 358Š—”64.) A. Reliefs on the main st´Œäpa. Among the most beautiful sculptures of the Indo- Afghan School, whether of stucco, clay or terraŠ—”cotta, are the reliefs already referred to, on the south face of the main st´Œpa at Mohra Moradu. This face was divided by slender pilasters into eight bays, each of which was subsequently adorned with a group of ´Œgures, comprising one or more images of the Buddha with attendant Bodhisattvas or devas, while the faces of the pilasters themselves were enriched with two seated ´Œgures of the Buddha, one above the other, some enthroned on lotuses, some on simple seats. Of these eight groups the most arresting is the one in the fourth bay from the western end, to which the premier place was evidently given in virtue of its being opposite, or virtually opposite, the central north-south axis of the st´Œpa drum. The group in this bay, nos. 30, 31 (Pls. I50, a, I 5 I), comprised a seated Buddha in the middle with a standing Bodhisattva on either side, two celestial beings (devas) coming out of the background, on each side of the BuddhaŠ—Ès head, and two other ´ŒguresŠ—”probably BodhisattvasŠ—”enthroned on lotuses in the top corners. The image of the Buddha in the centre is seated in the Teaching attitude (sŠ—Èz'kshdŠ—”mudra') on a lion-throne (simhaŠ—…sana), in front of which are four miniature ´Œgures of lay-worshippers, including perhaps the donor of the group, two on one side of a bowl, two on the other. All the reliefs are coated with a thin slip of ´Œne plaster, and there are traces on them of the buff, red and black paints with which such ´Œgures seem to have been invariably embellished. The beauty of the group is necessarily much impaired by the damage it has sustained, especially to the head and hands of the central image, but the attendant Bodhisattvas and the deva above the left shoulder of the Buddha give us a splendid conception of what the Indo-Afghan School, at its best, was capable of achieving. In the whole range of Indian sculpture it would be dif´Œcult to point to ´Œgures more beautifully conceived or more perfectly executed than these. Observe the Bodhisattva on the right (Pl. 151); how digni´Œed his posture, as he stands slightly inclining towards the central image; how calm his expression; how delicate the modelling of his features. And notice, too, with what consummate skill the sculptor has handled his garments, draping the dhoti ever so lightly and gracefully about his legs, turning the long scarf in stylish folds about his arms, and giving to the whole a delicate suggestion of movement, as if the Bodhisattva were being borne insensibly towards the Buddha. Then turn from this ´Œgure and observe the deva above, emerging out of the background. Nothing could be more tender than the attitude of his hands or more gentle than the expression on his face, as he descends from heaven to do homage to the Great Teacher. It is not only that these ´Œgures are nobly conceived; they are ´Œnished in every detail with exquisite grace and feeling. The draperies merit special notice. Although more formal and stylish than Hellenistic draperies, they exhibit the same technical methods as the latter in the treatment of their folds; that is to say, the mass of the material between the folds is cut away, and the folds themselves left standing out in relief, as they naturally 522 STUCCO SCULPTURES [CH. 26 do in any thin material. Roman sculptors, as is well known, made a practice of cutting away only the narrow folds and leaving the mass of the material between them unchiselled, thereby saving much labour but producing an effect which was not true to nature. Obviously it is much easier to adopt the Greek method when modelling in plaster or clay than when chiselling stone or marble, and, provided that a sculptor is conscientious in his work, it is the method to which, irrespective of tradition, he must inevitably be led, since it is the only one that is correct. But in the case of the Indo-Afghan School, there can be little room for doubt that in this, as in many other features, it inherited the Hellenistic tradition through the Gandhara School. That does not mean, of course, that this phase of art was merely a derivative or later re´Œäexion of Gandhara art. It owed many of its motifs and ideas and much of its hieratic character to that art, but it went far beyond it, both in pure decorative beauty and in the expression of religious sentiment, and in these spheres it established new and far-reaching traditions which profoundly in´Œäuenced the character of the Gupta and later medieval art of India. Compared with the foregoing, the reliefs in the other bays are of little interest. It might have been expected that the groups to the right and left would have been made to balance or at least to correspond in some measure with one another. But this was not the case. The bay on the left, i.e. the third in order from the south-west corner, contains the seated Buddha (no. 32: Pl. I 50, b) in the Teaching attitude, and on each side of him a Bodhisattva seated cross-legged on a lotus, while between them were smaller standing figuresI and other Bodhisattvas and devas above. The group is not unattractive, but it misses altogether the ´Œne feeling and masterly handling of the central one. The modelling of the Buddha is less sympathetic, his draperies coarser and more formal, and the two seated Bodhisattvas have none of the dignity and grace that belong to their standing counterparts in the other bay. Their drawing and modelling are weak, their ornaments not so re´Œned, and the countenance of the one on the right (the only countenance preserved) wears an almost fatuous expression. In the second and ´Œfth bays (nos. 33, 34=Pl. 152, a, b) the inferiority is still more marked. In each bay there are three seated Buddhas in the attitude of Teaching or of Meditation, and between them stand two Bodhisattvas. None of the ´Œgures, either seated or standing, has any pretention to artistic merit, let alone to spiritual beauty; they are merely stock types turned out, as it were, and repeated mechanically at so much a ´Œgure, as we shall see presently that thousands of miniature ´Œgures were repeated on the smaller st´Œpas. A typical specimen is the standing Bodhisattva on the right hand of panel 34, which is illustrated on a large scale on P1. I 55, 0. Setting it by the side of the corresponding ´Œgure of the central group, one can see at once how weak and ill-proportioned it is, the head and feet too big for the rest of the body, the features awry, the expression devoid of meaning, the ornaments and drapery clumsy and overdone.

The plates are curved to ´Œt the body and are of different sizes and patterns; some of their edges are straight, others curvilinear, while some are provided With hinges or pierced with small holes for lacing. The plates are so corroded that there is no possibility of separating them, but enough is visible to show that each was made up of several strips of metal, probably hammered together. It is not possible to determine for certain if they were riveted. Rectangular armour plates, either of iron or of lacquered leather, are ´Œgured on the skirts of soldiers in certain Gandhara reliefs (cf. Foucher, LŠ—ÈArt greŠ—ÈcoŠ—”bouddhique du Gandhdra, p. 405, ´Œgs. 202, 204), but the size and weight of these plates from Sirkap suggests that they served as armour for horses or even for camelsI or elephants, rather than for men. Horses and riders clad in mail or plate armour were from early times a feature of the Persian, Seleucid, Parthian and Sarmatian armies. A horseman with an armoured apron protecting his legs is ´Œgured on coins of the Saka satrap, Kharahostes (B.M. Cat. of Greek and Scythic coins of Bactria and India, Pl. XXIII, 6). About the second century AD. the idea was also copied by the Romans, to whom this class of heavy cavalry was known as the cataphracti (Korr’©tcppocK'rOI).Š—… Cf. Xenophon, Anab.

I The Parthian camelry, which was also heavily armed, may have been copied from the Roman dromedarii. The idea of the cataphract also spread eastward to China as early, probably, as the ´Œrst century B.C. Cf. Laufer, Chinese Clay Figures (1914), p. 217.

(Cf. F linders Petrie, Tools and Weapons, pp. 55, 56, and Pls. LXX, LXXI; Ency. Brit. sxv. Š—… Saddlery Š—È; Dar. et Sag. s11. Š—… Frenum Š—È.) The bits found at Taxila are of (a) and ([2) types only. They date from the ´Œrst century A.D. Arrian says that in the time of Alexander the Great the Indians did not curb their horses with bits like those in use among the Greeks and Kelts, but they ´Œtted round the horseŠ—Ès mouth a circular piece of ox-hide studded with iron or brass pricks pointing inwards but not very sharp; and within the horseŠ—Ès mouth they put an iron prong like a skewer, to which the reins were attached, so that when the rider pulled the reins, the prong controlled the horse and the pricks inside the muzzle goaded its mouth, compelling it to obey the reins.I That the Greeks introduced the snaf´Œäe-bit into India is corroborated by the fact that the Sanskrit word for Š—…bitŠ—È=khalina, is borrowed from the Greek xoOuv’©g. The spiked bit is still all too familiar in the North-West, 1 Cf. Arrian, Ind. 16. Strabo (XV, 66) says: Š—…Instead of bridles they use muzzles, which differ little from halters and the lips are perforated with spikes.Š—È CH. 27] IRON OBJECTS 551 but no examples of it have been found at Taxila.

If required for smearing antimony or kohl round the eyes the rod is slightly clubbed; if required as a toothpick or nail- cleaner, it is pointed; if as an ear-cleaner, it is furnished with a tiny scoop. Some of the rods are clubbed at both ends; others have a club at one end and a point or scoop at the other; others have a point at one end and a scoop at the other. The earliest specimens found at Taxila date from the third, or possibly fourth, century 3.0.; the latest from the ´Œrst century AD. In the earliest specimens from the Bhir Mound, bone or ivory is used for the simple clubbed antimony-rod, copper for the antimony-rod and ear-cleaner combined. In the later specimens from Sirkap, bone, ivory, copper, bronze and lead are used for the antimony-rods; bone, ivory and copper for the combination of ear-cleaner and toothpick; and copper only for the combination of antimony-rod and toothpick. The combination of antimony-rod and ear-cleaner has not been found in Sirkap. Antimony-rods or kohlŠ—”sticks, as they are sometimes called, were used in Egypt and the West from a very early age, and it is not unlikely that they and the ear-cleaners were introduced at TaXila by the Greeks.

The stilus was used for writing on wax; the calamus for writing with ink on parchment, birch-bark, etc. The average length of the stili is about 4-5 in., but some are considerably shorter, others considerably longer. Some have a ´Œne smooth point, others a ball point. In some, again, the butt is ´Œäattened like a chisel for smoothing out the wax; in others it is rounded.

Type (a) is found in both the Bhir Mound and Sirkap and was in use from the ´Œfth or sixth century B.C. to the ´Œrst century A.D.; but the earlier Bhir Mound specimens are distinguished from the Sirkap ones by having the point of the arrow-head somewhat better ´Œnished than the tang. Types ([2), (c) and (d) are found exclusively in the Bhir Mound and date from the fourth and third centuries B.C. Kautilya (bk. II, ch. 18) mentions arrows tipped with bone or wood as well as with metal, but these bone and ivory arrow-heads from Taxila could hardly have been intended for serious warfare, unless they were poisoned. Possibly they were employed for practice archeryI or for shooting birds; or it may be that they were found useful for the town police as being less deadly than iron ones.

4,18,93,A,,"18,93","4. Standing female ´Œgure in the round of chloritised mica schist, probably dating from the ´Œrst century B.C. Height 725 in. The pose is rigidly frontal, with feet front, legs together, and hands on hips. Save for ornaments consisting of anklets, girdle, crossed breast-chain, armlets and bangles, the ´Œgure is nude. The hair, which is treated like a wig in front, is taken back from the forehead and falls in a long plait down the back, with a few curls on each shoulder. On the top of the head is a low polos. Beneath the small base is a projecting tenon, evidently intended to ´Œt into a socket-hole. In ancient times the statuette was broken into two at the knees, and, in order to repair it, two small holes were drilled between the legs, one above and one below the fracture. The stiff frontal pose and the poles on the head suggest a Caryatid, but the ´Œgure is so small that it can hardly have served that purpose. Possibly the sculptor was endeavouring to portray an archaic type, such as that of the Š—…Mother or Earth goddessŠ—È, which was still being perpetuated at TaXila as late as the ´Œrst century A.D., but this is quite problematical.

The same observation applies to most of the terra-cotta and clay heads from the Kalawan monasteries, only that in their case the style and workmanship is of a very much higher order, putting them, along with the stucco reliefs of Mohra Moradu, among the ´Œnest products of the Indo-Afghan School.

We know now from these remains at Taxilaithat, whatever Hellenistic tradition may have lingered on into the ´Œfth century, the Indo-Afghan School was anything but a mimetic one. It was conservative to the extent that it perpetuated many of the orthodox forms ofBuddhist imagery, but it was essentially a living art, instinct with new energy and creative power, and it made most valuable contributions to the later art of Hindustan and Central India. The time when it may truly he said that art at Taxila was mainly an imitation of Hellenistic art was during the Parthian period, and we have only to turn to the stucco ´Œgures of that period from Sirkap to understand how degenerate Hellenistic art could become in the hands of Indian imitators who had no creative genius of their own. Three centuries later conditions had entirely changed: the sculptors of the Indo~Afgh’©in School were still making use here and there of Hellenistic motifs and ideas, but only to assimilate them into the body of their own art, which in its own way was just as original, forceful and independent as the Gupta art of HinduŠ—” stan and more so than contemporary Byzantine art in the West.

In diameter (13 in.) it is smaller than the two preceding examples, but the stones are more ponderous, and it is made of hard dark grey quartzite instead of the softer sandstone. Three other noticeable differences are: ´Œrst, that the surface of the nether-stone is concave (instead of straight, as in no. 28, or convex, as in no. 27); secondly, that crossing the upper stone from side to side is a deep groove into which a stout piece of wood could be ´Œxed horizontally, with a handle projecting on either side; thirdly, that the hole in the nether-stone into which the centre pivot was ´Œxed is not pierced through the entire thickness of the stone but sunk to rather less than half its thickness. (P1. 14.0, m.) Type b. Crushing-mills. This type of mill, which was also introduced at T axila during the Saka-Parthian period, was designed probably for the crushing and grinding of harder substances (e.g. chunam) than ordinary grain.

Amulets and pendants have been classed together in this section because it is impossible in some cases to be sure whether a particular pendant has an amuletic value or not. That the claw or tooth pendant (no. 80), the swastikas (no. 85), the pipal leaves (no. 88), the bell (no. 89), and the clubs (nos. 91, 92), were employed as amulets is beyond question, and it is equally certain that nos. 82Š—”4 were intended to hold relics or charms of some sort. But it is not so clear whether nos. 86, 87, 90, 93, 94 and 95 were designed as amulets or merely as ornaments.
