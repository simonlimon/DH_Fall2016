650 FINGER-RINGS AND GEMS [CH. 31

CLASS VIII. Glass ﬁnger-rings (nos. 67—9)

Nos. 67 and 68 are 'of the ﬁrst century A.D.; no. 69 of uncertain date, probably
early medieval. - ’

67. Fragment of glass ﬁnger-ring with ﬂat almond-shaped bezel. Diam. 0-81 in. The glass
is colourless and transparent. Sk. ’14—193; Block K (palace); sq. 163-52’; stratum II.
Cf. p. 177 supra.

68. Similar but of yellow glass. Diam. 0-75 in. Sk. ’16—161; Block E’; sq. 68-76’;
stratum III. Cf. p. 185 supra.

69. Fragment of ﬁnger-ring of dark blue and green opaque glass. Diam. 0-75 in. Dh. ’16—
254; mon. court A; 3 ft. below surface. Cf. pp. 278, 294 supra.

CLASS IX. Engraved gems of stone and paste intended for
ﬁnger-rings (nos. 70—5)
Like the rings themselves which have stones or pastes inset in their bezels, these

have been found only on the Sirkap and later sites. Fourteen date from the ﬁrst
century A.D. (Parthian); the remaining one from the ﬁfth century.

70. Oval intaglio of malachite with ﬁgure of a winged Nike armed with spear and holding
wreath and ﬁllet in outstretched hand, as on contemporary Indo—Parthian coins. Longer axis
075 in. Sk. ’22—566; Block E’; sq. 73-97’; stratum II. Cf. p. 185 supra. (Pl. 208, no. 53.)

71, a—z'. Nine oval intaglios of jacinth cut en cabochon and hollowed at back. They are engraved
with various full-length ﬁgures and busts. The best in point of execution is a ﬁgure of Athens
(10, f) with helmet, spear and shield, and a snake to left. Another draped and helmeted ﬁgure
(10, a) may also be the same goddess, but what looks like a shield may be the badly drawn wing
of a Nike. On h and 1' is portrayed a draped goddess with cornucopia, the one on the former
being helmeted. This may perhaps be the same goddess that is ﬁgured in nos. I and 2 of the
‘Stone Sculptures’, ch. 36. On b and g are ﬁgures of the winged Nike, the former with the
palm of victory between her legs instead of in her hand. The three remaining intaglios are very
roughly executed busts. Their head-dresses, however, are interesting. Fig. d wears a plumed
helmet with a curious projection above the rim in front; the other two (c and e) wear turbans
with the same projection in front. All the intaglios, except a and f, are of such rough workman-
ship that on grounds of style they might Well be attributed to the third or fourth century A.D.
That they date, however, from the ﬁrst century is proved by the association in which they were
found. Sk. ’13—194; Block E; sq. 77-65’; strata I—II (injar). Cf. p. 160, no. 4. supra; A.S.R.
(I912), p. 28. From same hoard as nos. 72 and 73 infra. (Pl. 207, no. 10, a—z'.)

72. Oval carnelian with ﬂat face engraved with bust intaglio. From the same jar as the
preceding. Cf. p. 160, no. 5.

73, a, b. Two oval intaglios of glass, the former (a) with ﬂat face, banded in green, white and
blue; the latter (1)) of dull brown glass fashioned en cabochon. In both specimens the engraving
is very worn and blurred. From same hoard as the preceding. Cf. p. 160, no. 6 supra.

74. Oval intaglio of carnelian with ﬁgure of Nike holding wreath and ﬁllet in right hand,
cornucopia in left. Face ﬂat; back convex. Longer axis 0- 5 in. Ss. ’15—95; Pindora; 3 ft. 6 in.

below surface. Cf. p. 220 supra. (Pl. 207, no. 9.)
75. Oval intaglio of chert, engraved with legend Sn" Kules'varadasa in Brahmi characters

of the ﬁfth century A.D. Longer axis 0-75 in. In. ’I7—F586; cell 3; 8 ft. below surface.
Cf. p. 385 supra. (P1. 207, no. 15.)
