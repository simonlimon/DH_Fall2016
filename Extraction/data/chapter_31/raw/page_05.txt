the early medieval period. No. 24 is of the ﬁrst century A.D. The last—mentioned,
as well as no. 23, are Indian rather than Hellenistic in form and decoration. The
symbols on no. 24 are all typically Indian.

on outside. Diam. 0-75 in. Probably ﬁfth century A.D. Dh. ’15—1,058; mon. court A.

24. Copper ﬁnger-ring composed of metal band with beaded edges, ﬂat on the inside and
relieved on the outside with nine bosses bearing symbols in relief. On the largest boss, which
takes the place of the bezel, is a ‘shield’ device, and on either side of it a triratna. The other
devices include a pair of ﬁshes, swastika, vajra and lotus rosette. The devices, which may be
either Buddhist or Iaina, more probably the former, were all endowed with amuletic properties.
Diam. 0-93 in. Sk. ’20—746; Block 1’; sq. 13-79’; stratum I. The form and decoration of the
ring suggest that it is an Indian pattern. For the triratna, cf. ‘Beads’, p. 747 and footnote;
for the ﬁshes, ‘Copper and Bronze’, no. 28, ‘Iewellery’, no. 78; for the swastika, ibid. no. 85.

oval or round. Of the ten specimens listed below, seven come from the Bhir
Mound and are referable to the fourth to second century B.C.; three come from
Sirkap and belong to the ﬁrst century A.D.
