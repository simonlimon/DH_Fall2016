(Pl. 146, no. 94.)
Type 12. Miniature trays of rock-crystal. We may surmise that these were used

for toilet cosmetics, but there is no proof of it. They have been found only in the
Bhir Mound.

through which a ﬁne hole is pierced on one side. Length 1-5 in. Of ﬁne workmanship; highly

making up the circle. (P15. 141, h; 147, a.)

96. Bm. ’21—983; sq. 16-63’; stratum II. Similar to preceding, but smaller, and with two
holes pierced through two edges. Length 1-12 in. (P13. 141, i; 147, a.)

CLASS XV. Toilet caskets (nos. 98—106)

Numbers of vessels of this class have been found in Sirkap and later sites, and,
thanks to the fact that they were used not only for toilet purposes but as convenient
receptacles for the sacred relics enshrined in stfipas, many of them are still in a
perfect state of preservation. Usually they are made of grey or micaceous schist,
but not infrequently of steatite; only one specimen is made of phyllite. Similar
caskets, almost always of steatite, had been made in other parts of India—notably in
Hindustan and Central India—as far back, at least, as the Maurya period and pro-
bably much earlier, but not a single specimen has been found in the Bhir Mound.
The earliest—belonging to the early Saka period (ﬁrst century B.C.)—comes from
the Dharmarajika.

The shapes of these caskets are not many. The commonest are globular and
slightly squat, like the modern lady’s pulf—box, the division between body and lid
being just above the middle; others are cylindrical and tall; others cylindrical and
shallow, like the Greek pyxis; others again—and these are smaller in size—have a
