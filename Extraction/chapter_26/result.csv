CH. 26] srucco SCULPTURES 523 affords a good opportunity of examining the technique of these ﬁgures. Over the plaster is a ﬁne slip of limetor more probably ﬁne ‘shell’ plaster, applied before the ﬁnal deﬁnition was given to the features. The paste must have been still soft when the slip was put on, and it was not until after the application of the latter that the ﬁne lines were impressed with a modelling tool around the nostrils, etc. The face is left white, but the lips, edges of nostrils, rims and folds of eyelids, edges of hair, folds of neck and ear—lobes, are picked out in red, and the hair is coloured grey-black.

For variety and extent the collection of stucco ﬁgures found at the suughdrdma of Jauliaﬁ is by far the most important at Taxila. It does not contain anything up to the standard of the ﬁnest reliefs at Mohra Moradu, but, on the other hand, it comprises countless examples of every kind of ﬁgurine employed in the ﬁfth century to adorn the smaller class of stﬁpas. In describing these stucco sculptures of Jauliaﬁ we shall start with thelarge and medium-sized images found in situ, then proceed to the smaller ﬁgurines also in situ, and close our account with the detached heads and other disjecta membm which were lying among the fallen debris. A. Large and medium-sized sculptures in situ. Nos. 39—42. These are found either in the image-shrines (e.g. no. 39 infra) or decorating the bases of stﬁpas (e.g. nos. 40, 41 and, 42) or in niches let into the monastery walls or on pedestals in front of some of the cells. On the base of the main stﬁpa the images are, as usual, divided one from the other by pilasters; on the smaller stﬁpas the pilasters are sometimes absent.",I53-c,Mm,,1915
39,,,,,"39. In. ’27~F 585. A ﬁne group of stucco ﬁgures found in chapel E I at Jauliaﬁ, and now in the museum. In the centre is seated the Buddha in the attitude of Meditation (dhydna-mudrd) with a standing Buddha to his right and left and two attendant ﬁgures behind. Of the latter, the one to his right is carrying the ﬂy-whisk (caun‘); the other, as suggested by his head-dress, is Indra, holding the thunderbolt (vajra) in his left hand. On the central image are still many traces of the red and black paint and of the gold—leaf with which it, and doubtless the other- 524 srucco SCULPTURES [on 26 ﬁgures also, were once bedecked. All ﬁve ﬁgures are of lime plaster, on a core of kaﬁjﬁr, rubble and clay. In style they are not on a par with the reliefs in the fourth bay of the main stﬁpa at Mohra Moradu (p. 521 supra), and the attendant ﬁgures are especially stiff and formal, but the central ﬁgure of the Buddha is an impressive example of the conventional images of this period and the ﬁnest, in a complete state, at TaXila. Soon after its discovery this group was shattered to bits by a fanatic, but reconstructed with inﬁnite skill and unwearying patience by my assistant, Mr M. Gupta. Cf. p. 377 supra; ju. Mem. Pl.

Four smaller ﬁgures of the Buddha, one in the s’ikslzd— and the others in the dhydna—mudrd, are seated, one above the other, on lotuses, on the faces of the pilasters. All of these ﬁgures, large and small, belong to the ﬁfth century A.D. The central image, like all such large images of this period, is composed of a core of large blocks of kaﬁjﬁr stone covered with clay, and ﬁnished with a thick coating of lime stucco. 'I‘he workmanship is rough and the style mechanical. (Pl. I 54, a.)",I 54-a,,,1927

This is probably one of the earliest of the smaller stﬁpas at Jauliaﬁ, and it’is not unlikely that the form of decoration found here represents an earlier stage than that found in most of the neighbouring stapes (eg. I) I, D4, A16), but, if this is so, the images of the Buddha must have been remade in the ﬁfth century A.D. since it is quite certain that, as they stand, they are among the latest reliefs on the site, being both stereotyped in style and coarse in workmanship.

Wears ear-pendants, necklaces and bangles. The state of preservation is excellent, but the modelling is mechanical and the features heavy and soulless. As a rule, Maitreya is seated in European fashion, and is seldom portrayed in the dhydna—mudrd. Cf. p. 373 supra. (Pl. I 55, d.) B. Small Sculptures in situ. Nos. 43—8 (cf. ch. 20, pp. 372—3). These are found on a large class of stﬁpas at Jauliaﬁ and elsewhere. The stﬁpas commonly have a square base, circular drum, dome and a range of umbrellas, but from most of them the super- structure has now perished and the bases only remain. The latter are generally divided into three horizontal tiers, diminishing in width and height as they ascend, and divided one from the other by dentil cornices. The principle of decoration is the same for all three tiers; it consists of a series of stunted pilasters with shallow niches between them. In the two lower tiers the pilasters are usually in the debased Corinthian style; in the uppermost, in the debased Persepolitan. The niches are in the form either of a trefoil arch or of a portal with sloping jambs, which was the form in fashion at this time for the doorways of monastery cells. These two forms of niches alternate with one another on the faces of the stﬁpas, both horizontally and verti- cally. Within the niches are seated Buddhas or Bodhisattvas—the former in the attitude either of Meditation or of Teaching; on either side of the niches, between them and the pilasters, are pairs of ﬁgures bringing offerings to or worshipping the Buddha. In order to increase the height of the two lower tiers without diminishing the number of niches, an extra row of ﬁgures was added at their base. Inthe lowest tiers these ﬁgures commonly consisted of the forefronts of lions alternating with atlantes, which are shown supporting the weight of the superstructure above them. In the second tier the lions were frequently replaced by elephants.   5.9.1,... weaned“? 0“ raw“. ». .. ,. A... w CH. 26] srucco SCULPTURES 525 To the above description it should be added that: (a) In the second and top tiers the forefronts of lions and elephants were sometimes added at the base of the portal jambs and trefoil arches which enclosed the niches. (b) The Perse— politan pilaster—capitals were usually crowned with bulls, back to back. (c) The atlantes generally took the form of warriors or musicians or ﬁgures holding wine- cups. (d) The ﬁgures beside the Buddha rest, as a rule, on a kind of lotus stool. Sometimes they are two Buddhas, seated and meditating; sometimes they are two monks or two lay-worshippers, kneeling and praying or bringing offerings of fruit or ﬂowers in their robes or in a basket, or occasionally with caskets in their hands, containing treasures of one kind or another (no. 43=Pl. 156, a). ((2) Figures of seated Buddha are sometimes substituted on the face of the Corinthian pilasters in place of the usual small incised panels, e.g. on the pilasters on the west face of stﬁpa D4 (no. 44=P1. 154, b). The above was the scheme of decoration on the majority of these small stﬁpas, but in some cases it was varied by inserting a row of seated Buddhas or Bodhisattvas side by side and without any adventitious decoration beneath the lowest course of lions and atlantes, as in stﬁpa A11. In a few cases, as in A15, the whole plinth was occupied by such ﬁgures, but as already stated, this may represent an earlier type of decoration. Such intensive repetition of ﬁgures is not found in stﬁpas of the earlier Gandhara School. The new fashion was to some extent the result of the stereotyping and commercialising of art; but it arose still more from the ever—growing practice of repeating the ﬁgures of the Blessed One in countless numbers, so that the donor of them might achieve a corresponding increase in the volume of his merit. The general appearance of these stﬁpa—bases will be clear from the illustrations of stﬁpas A16 and D4 (nos. 45~7) on Pls. 156 and 157. The former, which is the smaller of the two, is now in the local museum; the latter still stands on the spot where it was unearthed. Although the description given above applies accurately to both, there are certain features that merit further attention. One of these is that, while in stﬁpa A16 all the ﬁgures in the niches are Buddhas seated in the attitude of Teaching or of Contemplation, in theupper section of D4 as well as in D 1,,Bodhisattvas are substituted for some of the Buddhas. Another noteworthy feature is the sloppy and unconvincing postures of the atlantes, not only on these, but on all the stﬁpas of this period. It is a natural and logical expectation that any supporting ﬁgures of the kind, Whether atlantes or caryatids or animals, should be sufﬁciently big and strong to appear to support the super- incumbent weight; but these atlantes are not only absurdly small in proportion to the size of the structure, but they are in attitudes which suggest that, instead of sustaining the mass above them, they are being crushed beneath its burden. A third point of interest is that among the many pairs of attendants on the Buddhas or the Bodhisattvas we encounter here and there some women. One such pair of women occurs in a panel in the lower row on the north face of stﬁpa D4 (no. 48=Pl. 154, c). In the centre, is a meditating Buddha, and to right-and left of his trefoil niche a woman seated on a high seat in European fashion. The one to MT 67 Buddhas   526 STUCCO SCULPTURES [CH. 26 the proper right of the Buddha holds in both hands a covered vessel, the bottom of which rests on her left hand, while with her right hand she seems about to lift off the tall lid. The other one holds in her right hand a drinking—cup and in her left a spear. These are distinguishing attributes of Kubera, the dispenser of riches, in his capacity of leader of the yakshas, and later on were transferred to his consort Hariti, the demon mother of children and giver of prosperity. We may be sure, therefore, that these women are meant to be yakshiuis, embodying some popular superstition or other.I Hariti herself, so the legend goes, was converted by the Buddha and became an upasika‘ or lay—disciple; and to feed her 500 children, whom she had formerly fed on the ﬂesh of human children, Buddha told her that the bhikshus in the monasteries should every day offer her food from their portions. . Hence, I—tsing tells us, an image of Hariti was placed either in the porch or in the corner of the dining-hall of Indian monasteries, and abundant offerings of food were made to it.2 C.

(P1. 153, b.) The remaining Buddha heads from Iauliaﬁ, illustrated on P1. I 58, are much inferior in style and execution to the preceding, but they are the work of various hands and represent several characteristic types of which there are many more examples at Taxila. Thus, no. 52 belongs to a class of heads which are distinguished by a rather small chin and largish mouth, with the underlip deﬁned by a simple curve at the lower edge, giving a slightly supercilious look to the face. In this type, too, both the upper and lower eyelids are bordered by simple instead of reﬂex curves, and, as a rule, the cheek—bones are wide and pronounced, though more so in other examples than in the one illustrated. No. 53 on the other hand, has a narrower face with higher forehead, more rounded cheeks and a small mouth, which imparts to it a rather insipid and soulless expression; and the same remarks 1 Cf.

Increasing popularity of stucco and its causes   514 STUCCO SCULPTURES [011.26 the Dharmarajika. As already stated, the pylons were added to the plinth in the early part of the second century A.D., and there can be little doubt that the stucco ornamentation was contemporary with them. The ﬁgures are in the same style as the stone Gandhara reliefs which were preserved in chapel L close by, and it is not unlikely that they were executed by one or other of the artists responsible for those sculptures, since it is quite clear that the sculptor who designed and executed them must have come from Gandhara itself. (Cf. pp. 2 53‘4 supra.) Then, two or three generations later, we have the remains of some stucco images enshrined in the plinth niches of stﬁpas KI and N4, likewise at the Dharmarajika site. The best preserved of these is the ﬁgure of the Buddha on the north face of KI (p. 262 supra, and P1. 57, b), but even this is headless, and all that can be said of the draped body is that it is gracefully modelled and quite in keeping with the date assigned to it (late second or early third century A.D.). With these few exceptions, however, there are no surviving specimens of stucco ﬁgures at Taxila between the ﬁrst and fourth centuries A.D., nor have any examples of sculptures in this material been found at other contemporary sites in the North- West. During the Kushan period a vast amount of sculpture was, as we know, turned out in this part of India, but it seems to have been mainly executed in schist or phyllite from the region of Swat or in a white calcareous stone from the neighbour- hood of Jelalabad in Southern Afghanistan, or else in clay, which, save in very rare cases (where ﬁre has intervened to preserve it), has inevitably perished in the course of the ages. Before the discoveries at Taxila had thrown new light on the subject, it used to be thought that the remains of numerous stucco reliefs found at Sahri— Bahlol, Takht-i—Bahi and other sites belonged to the Kushan period and were contemporary with the familiar stone reliefs of the Gandhara School. It is now clear that this was a mistake. All the reliefs in question are in precisely the same style as the fourth- to ﬁfth—century work at Taxila, and there can be no question that they are of the same age.I The same is true also of the numerous stucco ﬁgures unearthed by the French Mission at Hadda and other sites in Afghanistan.2 At this time stucco, as a material for sculpture, was assuming an importance which it had not known before and has not known since. In the new School which began to take shape in the fourth century—a School which we may conveniently designate the ‘Indo-Afghan’——-stucco was coming to be used not only in place of stone but largely in place of clay as well. Over stone it naturally had a signal advantage in that it needed no chisel for its carving, could be easily manipulated I Cf. The Stﬁpas and Monasteries at jauliaﬁ (A.S.I. Mem. no. 7), p. 33, Where M. Foucher accepts the late Dr D. B. Spooner’s interpretation and dating of certain stucco reliefs. The head from Takht-i- Bahi said by the latter to have come from a Temptation Scene was in all likelihood that of a grotesque atlant, and the two mutilated ﬁgures at the side of a Buddha from Sahri—Bahlol may well have repre— sented the donors. At the best their evidence is very questionable. Cf. A.S.R. (1907—8), pp. 136—7 and ibid. (1909—10), p. 48. 7' E.g.

On the other hand, though less plastic than clay, it was far more durable, especially in positions exposed to the weather. This convenience in handling and this durability of stucco go far to explain its growing popularity among the Indo—Afghan sculptors, but there were other reasons also for this popularity which must not be lost sight of. One was that since the eclipse of the Gandhara School under the Kushans, the chief centres of art in the North-West had shifted from the spots where stone could be readily procured for sculpture. At Taxila itself, which was certainly one of the most important of these centres, the only kinds of stone available were an excessively hard limestone, which was too refractory to be carved into statues, and a soft porous kaﬁjﬁr, which was too soft and coarse to be cut into subtle and delicate forms. In Southern Afghanistan sculptors seem to have been little better off. The ﬁne hornblende- and mica—schist stones which had been used by the sculptors of Gandhara, were not to be found there, and in default of these they had to fall back on a local variety of white porous limestone, which was by no means so well suited to their purpose. With the rise, however, of the Indo-Afghan School they pro- ceeded to follow the same course as their brethren at Taxila and to make use almost exclusively of stucco, clay and terra-cotta. Another reason for the freer use of stucco at this period was the facility it offered for the reduplication of Buddha or Bodhisattva images, to which increasing im- portance had come to be attached. Under the early Kushans, the decoration of stﬁpas and chapels had consisted largely of scenes from the previous births or from the last life of the Buddha, but these scenes, so familiar in Gandhara art, had fallen out of fashion, and by the ﬁfth century AD. the creation of an image of the Buddha or (if one of the Bodhisattvas had come to be regarded as a work of merit in itself, and the more images of this kind that a man could get fashioned, the more likely was he to attain the geal of his salvation. Hence arose the practice of erecting an everaincreasing number of stﬁpas and of decorating them from head to foot with countless repetitions of these sacred figures. And in the fashioning of them stucco was an invaluable agent, since with its aid it became possible to turn out ﬁgure after ﬁgure (many, it might be, from one and the same mould) with the greatest possible expedition and at the smallest cost. Among the thousands of stucco reliefs recovered amid the ruins of the later Buddhist monuments at T axila, it goes without saying that all are not of the same age. The destruction of most of the monuments to which they belonged took place, as we have seen, in the latter part of the ﬁfth century A.D., and at the time when it happened some had no doubt been standing for several decades, some had survived from Kushan times or even earlier, and others had probably been erected in quite recent years. It is tempting, therefore, to try and arrange these Indo—Afghan sculptures in some sort of chronological sequence, and since we have no precise evidence of their respective dates, to endeavour to do so on the basis of their style alone. It is questionable, however, if such an attempt can ever succeed. Without doubt, there are many striking differences in the style of these reliefs. Reduplication of sacred images Age and varying merit of stucco reliefs of Indo- Afghan School 516 sTUcco SCULPTURES [(3H, 26 Some are as beautiful as any examples of the sculptor’s art found in India; others are crude and spiritless efforts, which have little claim to be called art at all. But the differences between them are due, less to the progress or decay of art, than to the varying skill or idiosyncrasies of their authors. To take but one example, namely, the reliefs on the south side of the Mohra Moradu Stﬁpa, we know that all these reliefs belong to the same period. Of this there can be no reasonable doubt. But if we had not known this, and if the ﬁgures of which they are composed had not been found in situ, we might well have concluded that the coarse and nerve— ; less reliefs in the outer bays belonged to a more decadent phase in the history of the Indo—Afghan School than the magniﬁcent group in the fourth bay. Until, then, 1 1 further and more precise evidence comes to light, it is clear that we must beware 1 of using the style of these sculptures as a criterion of their age, and be content, 1 meanwhile, to treat them all as belonging to one indivisible group} notwithstanding 1 that they vary greatly in style and merit. g1 and their As to the technique of these sculptures, the bodies, legs and arms of the larger ‘ te‘ihmque ﬁgures were usually composed of soft kaﬁjﬁr stone and mud, covered with a thick 1 coat of the same coarse and friable plaster with which the walls were faced. On the ‘ 1 other hand, the heads were made of a ﬁner and more lasting kind of plaster, and l l 3 l i then mortised into the neck, sometimes with a piece of wood to strengthen the joint, sometimes without. Thanks partly to their shape and partly to the stronger material of which they were made, the heads were naturally able to resist the 1 pressure of the fallen debris or the percolation of rain-water better than the bodies; ‘ and this explains why, on many sites on the North-West Frontier, the heads un- earthed have far outnumbered the bodies and led some excavators to infer that heads alone may sometimes have been set up on the walls of the shrines. From the excavations at Taxila it is now clear that this inference was mistaken, and that originally the number of heads was equal to the number of bodies. This observation is true of smaller as well as larger ﬁgures, but the bodies of the former are usually composed of plaster throughout and are proportionably stronger than the bodies of the latter. In the case of the smaller reliefs,2 the entire body was separately modelled and then impaled on a stick and so afﬁxed to the still fresh coating of i plaster on the wall; and even the tolerably large ﬁgures on the plinth of stﬁpa A I 5 at Jauliaﬁ seem to have been treated in this way. In the modelling of the ﬁgure, ‘ a common practice seems to have been to work the plaster freely into shape with . the boasting tool, and then to ﬁnish it off, when dry, with a chisel. This procedure, however, was by no means invariable. Many of the reliefs, especially the smaller g ones, retain a ﬁne slip of lime or shell plaster, which was applied before the ﬁnal . deﬁnition was given to the features, and it is evident from the ﬁne lines impressed ’l with a modelling tool round the nostrils, etc., that the paste below the slip must have been still moist when the latter was applied. The slip itself was white or cream coloured. Red was commonly used to pick out the lips, edges and folds of   I On this subject, see also The Stﬁpas and Monasteries at yauliﬁﬁ, pp. 37—8. l 2 Ibid.

Black or grey-black was used for the hair, eyebrows, and pupils of the eyes. In some ﬁgures of atlantes, however, red instead of black is found on the hair, beard and moustache; and red was also used on the robes of the Buddha and for indicating the wheels (one of the mahdpurusha laksltazzas) on the soles of his feet. It is to be noted, however, that in some cases the red colouring on face and garments served only as a groundwork for gilding, which time has since destroyed. In attempting, therefore, to visualise these stucco ﬁgures in their pristine beauty, we must remember always to take into account the polychromy and gilding with which they were freely embellished. Let it be added that moulds were used on occasion by the sculptors of TaXila, as they were used also by the sculptors of Central Asia, but with one signal difference; for whereas the latter endeavoured to get the entire front View of the head, including head-dress and ears, out of a simple mould and were compelled in consequence to ﬂatten the faces of their ﬁgures, the artists of TaXila were content to employ the mould merely for the most difﬁcult part of the head, Viz. the mask, leaving the remaining parts—ears, hair, head-dress and neck—to be executed by hand, and thus achieving an altogether more varied and artistic result.

I, from the apsidal temple D in Sirkap=Sk. ’13~2,o43; sq. 56-63’; stratum II. The head, of which the height is 8-12 in., is that of a typical Greek satyr, with pointed ears, broad ﬂat nose, moustache, beard and free-ﬂowing locks. There is nothing mechanical or crude about the workmanship. The features are modelled with feeling, and there is an intensity of expression in the knitted brows and half-parted lips and a boldness in the treatment of the hair and beard that bespeak a thorough mastery over the material, but at the same time a proper understanding of its L” limitations. The strong, almost portrait-like individuality that characterises the countenance is typical of Greek art in its later phases; it is never found in early Indian art; nor is it a characteristic of the Gandhara School. With this and the following head the reader should compare the little head of Dionysus in silver repoussé ﬁgured in P1. 209, a, which is equally characteristic of Hellenistic craftsmanship. A.S.R.

Unfortunately, the upper part of the head is mutilated, but what remains is quite enough to show that the sculptor had an intimate knowledge of Hellenistic art. Cf. A.S.R. (1912), P1. XVIII, c. These are the sculptures executed by local craftsmen in more or less imitation of Greek or Graeco-Roman models. Some of them resemble the small terra-cotta ﬁgurines of this period found at Akra and other contemporary sites, including Sirkap itself. (‘ Terra—cottas’, ch. 24, nos. 46—9; Pl. 133.) On the top of the head there is commonly a topknot encircled with a bandeau or wreath, which is often much too small for the size of the head.‘ In front, the hair either falls over the forehead in short strands or is rolled back over the ears. Sometimes it is plaited or braided or curled along the front edge, as in archaic Greek statues. The sculptures of this class fall into the following ﬁve subdivisions, the charac— teristics of which appear to be mainly due to the idiosyncrasies of the sculptors. Type a. With nose of normal size, short upper lip and small, rather insigniﬁcant mouth. The eyes are carelessly modelled. 3. Sk. ’13-2,088; sq. 54-62’; stratum II. Height 6 in.

Belonging to the same class as the above but in sharp contrast with them, by reason of the different treatment of the eyes, is the head Sk. ’12; Trench A 481; stratum II (height 4-12 in.). In this case the eyes are wide open and staring, with highly arched eyebrows, while the hair is arranged in ringlets with a topknot above, as it was on heads of the Buddha.

(Pl. 149, f, g, i, j.) GROUP B. SCULPTURES OF THE INDO-AFGHAN SCHOOL (FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES AD.) The sculptures of the Indo-Afghan School, which are represented by the following examples, fall into certain well-deﬁned categories. In the ﬁrst come the ﬁgures of the Buddha, which, as we have already seen, retain, generally, the traditional characteristics which distinguished them in the Gandhara School. In the second are the Bodhisattvas, which are generally recognisable at a glance by their elaborate head-dresses and the profusion of their jewellery. To the third category belong the monks, who wear the same robes as their Master but, unlike him, have shaven heads; and along with the monks a few specimens of Brahmanical ascetics. The fourth category comprises a multitude of devas and lay-worshippers, both male and female, who are represented making offerings or doing obeisance to the Blessed One or to the Bodhisattvas. In the ﬁfth category is included an equally numerous and varied company of yakshas or genii, which share, with the lions and elephants, the burden of supporting the tiers of the stﬁpa—plinths. These atlantes, as we may rightly call them, since the original conception of them was certainly derived from Greek prototypes, are depicted with an endless variety of grotesque faces and in every kind of writhing, and tormented posture. The lions and elephants, as well as the bulls which crown the Persepolitan pilasters, make up the sixth and last category. CH. 26] STUCCO SCULPTURES 521 STUcco RE’LIEFS OF MOHBA MORADU. Nos. 30—8, at. (Cf. ch. 18, pp. 358—64.) A. Reliefs on the main stﬂpa. Among the most beautiful sculptures of the Indo— Afghan School, whether of stucco, clay or terra—cotta, are the reliefs already referred to, on the south face of the main stﬁpa at Mohra Moradu. This face was divided by slender pilasters into eight bays, each of which was subsequently adorned with a group of ﬁgures, comprising one or more images of the Buddha with attendant Bodhisattvas or devas, while the faces of the pilasters themselves were enriched with two seated ﬁgures of the Buddha, one above the other, some enthroned on lotuses, some on simple seats. Of these eight groups the most arresting is the one in the fourth bay from the western end, to which the premier place was evidently given in virtue of its being opposite, or virtually opposite, the central north-south axis of the stﬁpa drum. The group in this bay, nos. 30, 3 I (Pls. I 50, a, I 5 I), comprised a seated Buddha in the middle with a standing Bodhisattva on either side, two celestial beings (devas)coming out of the background, on each side of the Buddha’s head, and two other ﬁgures—probably Bodhisattvas—enthroned on lotuses in the top corners. The image of the Buddha in the centre is seated in the Teaching attitude (s’ikshd—mudrd) on a lion-throne (simhdsana), in front of which are four miniature ﬁgures of slay-worshippers, including perhaps the donor of the group, two on one side of a bowl, two on the other. All the reliefs are coated with a thin slip of ﬁne plaster, and there are traces on them of the buff, red and black paints with which such ﬁgures seem to have been invariably embellished. The beauty of the group is necessarily much impaired by the damage it has sustained, especially to the head and hands of the central image, but the attendant Bodhisattvas and, the dew above the left shoulder of the Buddha give us a splendid conception of what the Indo—Afghan School, at its best, was capable of achieving. In the whole range of Indian sculpture it would be difﬁcult to point to ﬁgures more beautifully conceived or more perfectly executed than these. Observe the Bodhisattva on the right (Pl. 151); how digniﬁed his posture, as he stands slightly inclining towards the central image; how calm his expression; how delicate the modelling of his features. And notiCe, too, with what consummate skill the sculptor has handled his garments, draping the dhoti ever so lightly and gracefully about his legs, turning the long scarf in stylish folds about his arms, and giving to the whole a delicate suggestion of movement, as if the Bodhisattva were being borne insensibly towards the Buddha. Then turn from this ﬁgure and observe the dew above, emerging out of the background. Nothing could be more tender than the, attitude of his hands or more gentle than the expression on his face, as he descends from heaven to do homage to the Great Teacher. It is not only that these ﬁgures are nobly conceived; they are ﬁnished in every detail with exquisite grace and feeling. The draperies merit special notice. Although more formal and stylish than Hellenistic draperies, they exhibit the same technical methods as the latter in the treatment of their folds; that is to say, the mass of the material between the folds is cut away, and the folds themselves left standing out in relief, as they naturally","149-f-g-i-j, 151",Sk,2,1913
