was somewhat greater thanrthe small allowance of 0-7 gr. tr. made for the smallest
unit, but having regard to the heavier weights, it seems unlikely that it could have
been much greater; had it been so, the wear and tear in their case would have been ‘
excessive. Comparing these calculated ﬁgures with the individual weights, we see
that, out of the last eighteen items in the series, there are only two whose weight
exceeds the ﬁgure calculated, viz. nos. 17 and 24, the former being 6 gr. in excess
of 424 and the latter 3 gr. in excess of 106. This is a very slight error when we
consider the great irregularities in the weights of coins belonging to one and the
same issue, and the diﬂiculty of determining exact weights with the kind of scales
or other instruments which were then available. Moreover, it is to be noticed that
these two are among the weights which have no cavities in them, and it is quite
possible, therefore, that they had not passed the ofﬁcial test.

So far, then, the sequence of ratios is clear; but the remaining items of the list,
viz. nos. 1—7, offer more difﬁculty. Taking no. 7 ﬁrst, it is to be noted that this
weight is a particularly well-preserved one, without chip or cavity, and that there
is no allowance, therefore, to be made except for ordinary wear and tear, which
with a heavy ball such as this may be put down at, say, 20 or 30 gr. The ratio, then,
which this weight evidently represents is the 104th in the series, having a calculated
weight of 5,512 gr. tr., as compared with the actual weight of 5,480 gr. tr. or 5,510,
