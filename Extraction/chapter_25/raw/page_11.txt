querns of this type have been found in the Bhir Mound settlement, which is
antefior to about 200 B.C. The quern then in use was the stool—quern with four
legs. For Egyptian stool—querns, cf. Flinders Petrie, Tools and Weapons, Pl. LV,
no. 105—a type which is found in ancient Egypt as early as the IVth Dynasty.
The Indian examples are usually decorated with simple designs, which, as time
went on, became more and more ornamental. Whether this type of quern was
used generally for the grinding of corn is questionable. The ornamental carvings on

many of the specimens suggest that they were meant for the grinding of spices,

kari, etc., rather than of corn. It 1s true that the earliest example of the circular
grinding-mill found at TaXila 1s not earlier than the ﬁrst century A. D. ,but It is quite
possible that the grinding of cereals was chieﬂy done at or near the farms where
the grain was grown, not in the city. On the other hand, the grinding—mill is found
in most of the early medieval monasteries, and this fact, contrasted with its complete
absence from any of the earlier settlements, goes far to show that it did not super-
sede the quern unti after the beginning of the Christian era. For Greek and Roman

Type 5. Stool—querns.

The stool—quern is invariably made of sandstone, never of quartzite or other
hard stone, and is usually decorated with carvings in relief. Some of the earlier
specimens from the Bhir Mound have the upper surface scored with zigzag lines
or other patterns lightly incised. In the later specimens of Mathura sandstone
from Sirkap the carving is much more elaborate, and at one end the quern slab
usually projects well beyond the legs and is supported on brackets.

These specimens were no doubt made by the stone-carvers of Mathura and
brought thence to Taxila.
