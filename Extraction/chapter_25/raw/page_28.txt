CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 503

Thatwds. Three of these implements were found at one spot in Sirkap, viz.:

127, a. Sk. ’24—I,30I; Block C; sq. 4746’. Of hornblende-gneiss (length 6-37 in.) with
cylindrical handle and ﬂat body. Two others are of gneiss but the handles are unﬁnished
(length 8-25 in). Saka—Parthian period. Cf. p. 210 supra. (P1. 146, no. 127, a.)

128. Another specimen of hornblende-gneiss (length 7-5 in.) came from Pindora in Sirsukh
and is probably of the fourth or ﬁfth century A.D. Cf. p. 220 supra. (Ss. ’15—81; 2 ft. 3 in.

below surface.) (Pl. 146, no. 128.)

A. "Ring—stones. Four specimens of these singularly interesting stones have been
found at T axila—three in the Bhir Mound and one in the second stratum of '
Sirkap, but the style and workmanship of the latter leave’no room for doubt that
it belongs to the same (Maurya) age as the others. The peculiar sanctity with which
ring-stones are invested in India is well known and can be traced back to an
immemorial age. Large numbers of them, dating from the fourth or third millen-
nium B.C. have been unearthed at Mohenjo—daro and Harappa—some no bigger
than a ﬁnger-ring, some so large that it takes half a dozen men to lift them; while
among famous examples of to-day may be mentioned the Srigundi stone at Malabar
Point near Bombay, which is believed to purify those who crawl through it of
disease and sickness, and the equally potent one at Satrunjaya, the hole in which is
known as muktdwdra=‘door of absolution’———the door which gives happiness to
anyone who can creep through it. The idea underlying all these ring—stones is the
same; they are regarded as yonis or female symbols of generationI—the idea being
that these W119 pass through them are, as it were, born again, while in the case of
the smaller starlets sf therewith: class the mere passing of the hand or ﬁnger through

hole, thus indiesting in smartest-that canes: be mistaken the connexion between
them and the female principled It is net unlikelythat the ‘Fertility goddess’ here
represented may have been identiﬁed with the ‘ Earth goddess ’ Prithivi. The earth
itself was conceived of as wheel—shaped in the Rigeedo,3 and it is said to be ‘ circular ’
in the Satapatha Brdhmana. A disk of terra-cotta bearing an image in relief of
a ‘ Fertility goddess ’ was unearthed by me at Bhita in 1911—12, and is published in
my Report for that year.4 It belongs to the Kushan or Early Gupta period and
depicts the goddess with legs wide apart and with a lotus (emblem of birth) issuing
from her neck in place of her head. A similar plaque was also found at Kosam and
is now in the Indian Museum.5 With these may be compared a sealing from
