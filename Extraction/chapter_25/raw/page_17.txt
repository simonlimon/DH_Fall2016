Only two complete specimens of this class of vessel have been found, both from
‘ the Saka-Parthian city in Sirkap, but from the Greek level in the same site comes the
fragment of a small cylindrical vessel of agate, which may have been used for the same
purpose; and from Jandial a small phial of limestone, which was probably meant

CLASS XIII. Goblets (nos. 60, 61). Cf. ‘Pottery’, ch. 23, Class XIV; ‘Copper
and Bronze’, ch. 28, Class XIV; ‘ Silverware’, ch. 29, Class III

There are many goblets of earthenware, copper, bronze and silver belonging to
the Parthian period at TaXila, but only two specimens in stone. Both are of the
standard type, but owing to their material very heavy, inconvenient vessels, and
without the widely ﬂared mouth which distinguishes so many of the earthenware
and metal specimens. Cf. ‘Pottery’, ch. 23, nos. 88—91 ; ‘ Silverware’, ch. 29, nos.
5, a, b; ‘Copper and Bronze’, ch. 28, nos. 266—73. This standard type of goblet
is identiﬁed with the Greek Kipcbplov, Lat. ciborium, by Dar. et Sag. I, p. 1171,
but on what grounds is not clear. ,

6o. Sk. ’13—173; Block G; sq. 108-62'; stratum II. Standard goblet of micaceous schist,
decorated in low relief with band of quatrefoil rosettes between dog-tooth borders, and with
lotus leaves below, springing upwards from the stem. Height 612 in. Damaged on one side
and at foot. Cf. p. 168 supra; A.S.R. (1912), P1. XXX, d. (Pls. I4I,j; 14.3, o.)
