Elephants Terra—cotta elephants are found in both the Bhir Mound and Sirkap. Some have riders, some not. Some are quite plain, others are provided with trappings, and others, again, are adorned with stamped designs. As a rule, the earlier specimens from the Bhir Mound are more ornamental than, the later from Sirkap. No. 72, however, from the Bhir Mound is quite plain, and no. 73 from the same site has only a girth and neck ropes to relieve its plainness, but most of the Bhir Mound specimens are embellished with a variety of small patterned squares or triangles or circles or lozenges stamped on the surface of the head and trunk. One elephant only of this class comes from Sirkap, viz. no. 75, and in this case there is only one stamped device instead of several, and the workmanship has become noticeably cruder. Some effort towards decoration has been made in the case of the Sirkap elephant no. 76, but the ornament consists only of a row of incised circles to indicate the girth, and a group of similar circlets on the head to indicate perhaps the head-cloth. The few examples of these elephants which carry riders come exclusively from the Bhir Mound, and are easily recognisable from the peculiar way in which the legs and seats of the riders are ﬂattened against the body of the elephants. Evi- dently the toy—makers from T axila had much greater difﬁculty in giving the riders 3 a natural seat on the backs of these great beasts than the sculptors of Saﬁchi had. 5 Possibly they were not so much at home with the elephant as were their fellow craftsmen of Central India and Hindustan. It is evident, too, that in the pre—Greek period represented on the Bhir Mound these toy elephants were much greater favOurites than later on, when the Maurya rule had been replaced by the Yavana. As regards technique, most of the elephants are solid throughout, but a few of the largest ones from the Bhir Mound (e.g. nos. 78 and 79), like some of the largest horses, have hollow bodies and legs. This is for the sake of lightness. Such speci- mens are not very well modelled nor are they embellished with stamped designs. With few exceptions, the clay is red and well-burnt but Without any slip, though in one or two of the better examples a wash has been applied to the surface. Only rarely is the clay grey-black, e.g. in no. 76 and in the miniature elephants nos. 80 and 81. The tusks are of one piece with the rest of the beast, not inserted, as they sometimes are in other parts of India, into sockets. The eye is generally diamond—shaped and stamped, but sometimes lozenge-shaped. 3%     CH. 24] TERRA—GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 455",,Sk,6,1929

The clay, is usually red and well burnt, sometimes with a grey core, sometimes red throughout. The saddle—horse no. 83 is of bull- coloured clay with traces of a thin red paint. The horses on wheels come from the Bhir Mound only. Besides these there are horses with harness, some with saddles, some without; and one very small specimen with a rider. ' Of the saddled horses illustrated in P1. 13 5, one specimen (no. 83) comes from the Bhir Mound and one from the Sirkap (no. 87). In the former, the saddle, which rose high in front and rear, was kept in positiOn by a girth—band passed over the top, with a breast-band in front and a crupper behind. The latter is a crudely fashioned little toy, and all that can be made out of it is that the saddle was four- peaked, with two peaks in front and two behind, and that it was held with a crupper behind. Cf. also no. 86, a rather better specimenof the four—peaked saddle. As a rule, the toy horses from the Bhir Mound are, like the elephants, more ornamental but less truthfully modelled than those from Sirkap; but whereas the 58-2 Horses 456 TERRAuCOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [011. 24 elephantvwas the more favourite toy in the Maurya period at T axila, the horse was more fashionable under the Greeks, Sakas and Parthians. In the Bhir Mound examples, the head—stalls are composed, like the Indian head~stalls of this period in Hindustan and Central India, of vertical cheek—straps and face—strap with horizontal front- and nose—bands, and sometimes an extra strap between the front- and nose-bands. Thus, in these early examples, the straps making up the head-stall were either vertical or horizontal. In the later examples from Sirkap, on the other hand (e.g. nos. 88 and 89), there are usually cross-straps running obliquely from the middle of the face-strap to the ends of the bit. At the junction of the straps in both earlier and later types there is commonly a boss, medallion or rosette. For head—stalls at Saﬁchi, see Maisey, Sdﬁchi and its Remains, Pl. XV, figs. 14 and 15. In the true Indian harness, plumes were almost invariable, both for riding and driving horses. Even in the toys, plumes are very commonly shown, not only in the, earlier specimens from the Bhir Mound but in the later ones from the Greek, Salsa and Parthian settlements in Sirkap. ' Observe that in no. 82-~a large hollow toy—there is a ﬂy—whisk of loOse. leather straps hanging from the middle of the front band. In this specimen the eye is formed of a small applied circlet with a hole in the middle. In no. 84 the, eye is formed of a round pellet crossed bya straight incision. In the later examples from Sirkap the eyes are twice or thrice as large, and are generally worked up or incised ' in the body of the clay; in some cases, however, they are applied.

Toy animals without carts or wheels (nos. 72—107),"44.0 TERRA—GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [CPL 24 likely to occur, and so far from expecting to ﬁnd other examples of such ﬁgures, one can only marvel at the extraordinary luck of ﬁnding any at all. With the exception of these Buddhist groups, which are partly of sunudriecl clay and partly of terracotta, all the objects described below are of terra—cotta. Most of them come from the Bhir Mound and Sirkap cities, but it is a curious fact that none were found in the lowest (fourth) stratum of the Blur/Mound, and of the very few from the third stratum some are undoubtedly strays from the second, and the rest cannot be dated much earlier than the close of the fourth century B.C. This can hardly be other than a coincidence, since terra~cotta ﬁgurines and toys are frequent even in the prehistoric sites of the Indus, and they must have been fabricated at all periods when household pottery was in use. As will be seen from the stratigraphical chart below, the collection from the Bhir Mound comprises ﬁgurines of a primitive idol type as well as a few of a mundane character, votive reliefs representing various male and female deities, potuheilied dwarfs (kumbhdzzda) animal and other toys, playing—dice, personal ornaments, including heads, a few specimens of ritual tanks, and an dycigapaga plaque of substantially later date than the rest. Among all these pieces the only one of Hellenistic design is the medallion or bulla no. 137, with the relief of a lion killing a bull. No. 135 may be an Indian transcript of a Greek original, such as no. 136. Nosao and 27 may also show some Western inﬂuence, and nos. :8 and r9 Egyptian inﬂuence. But, with these few exceptions, all the terra~cottas from the Bhir Mound are characteristically Indian and clearly indicate the direction from which the arts and crafts of Taxila drew their inspira- tion under the rule of the Mauryas. The primitive—looking little idols nos. 1—5 probably represent a type of Nude Mother or Earth goddess which had been handed down from immemorial anti- quity. Four of these idols come from the Bhir Mound—no. I from stratum III, nos. 3, 4 and 5 from stratum II. No. 2 comes from the lowest (pre-Greek) settlement on Sirkap, which may be as old or older than anything on the Bhir Mound. But we must beware of attributing a high antiquity to all these small' idols. Some of them—particularly nos. I, 2 and 3—may be, and probably are, relics of a remote past, which, like the neolithic celts described in chapter 25, nos. 1—5, were still regarded as objects of veneration or curiosity in the fourth and third centuries B.C. On the other hand, we know that idols of the same type and much the same primitive appearance were still being fashioned in the ﬁrst century A.D. for use in ritual tanks (e.g. nos. 158 and 159 infrazPl. 136, w, x), and it may be, therefore, that none of these specimens was older than the stratum in which it was found. When we turn from the Bhir Mound to the Sirkap terra~cottas, we note some conspicuous differences between them. After the Bactrian Greek conquest (which marks the dividing line between the two sites) the inﬂuence of Maurya India fades out and is replaced by Hellenistic inﬂuence from the West. The characteristic eX-voto reliefs of the Maurya period now cease to be manufactured.

(1915), Pl. VIII, 6. (P1. 135, dd.) An interesting type of personal ornament, found chieﬂy in the Bhir Mound, takes the form of a round medallion or bulla of terra—cotta, usually convex on its outer side and decorated with reliefs. Some specimens are provided with one or two small holes for attachment, pierced either from back to front or transversely across the face. Other specimens have no holes at all. In the simpler ﬁkinds the decoration consists of rosettes or circular beaded mouldings; in the more elaborate ones the beaded circles are centred with human masks or ﬁgures in relief or with a geometric design. What purpose these medallions served is uncertain. Possibly they may have been in the nature of amulets, like the ballae which Roman boys wore as a protection against the fascination of the evil eye; or they may have been simple ornaments (possibly some were ear—rings) without any particular talismanic signiﬁcance. Whether they were of Indian or foreign origin is open to question, but it is noteworthy that the human masks are characteristically Greek, while the relief of the lion attacking a bull is certainly not Indian.

The moulds take the form of ﬂat circular tablets of terra-cotta, with the impress of half a d0zen or a dozen coins in each, the coins being those of the Saka kings, Maues and Azes II. The moulds themselves appear to date from the closing years of the Parthian rule at TaXila, when the kings whose coins are ﬁgured on them had long since passed away. It is well known, however, and there is abundant evidence at TaXila itself to show, that these and many other coins, some even older than the issues of Maues, continued in circulation throughout the Parthian period, and no doubt the forgers, whoever they were, found it safer to copy the older issues rather than to forge the current coins of the realm.

Among the many objects of earthenware from the Bhir and Sirkap Mounds it remains only to describe certain small votive or ritual tanks of a kind Virtually new to Indian archaeology. These tanks do not number more than ﬁfteen in all, inclusive of fragments, and out of this number four were found, as already stated,I alongside the base of the small stﬁpa in the Parthian palace of Sirkap, where they were still evidently occupying the places where they had originally been dedicated; a ﬁfth was lying loose in the debris near by, and two others were found in the court— yard of the stﬁpa in Block A. As there are grounds for believing that these two stﬁpas were Jaina rather than Buddhist structures, and as none of the tanks has been found at any of the innumerable Buddhist stﬁpas at Taxila, it is not unreason- able to surmise that they were particularly connected with Jaina ritual. Earliest type a. In the earliest form represented at TaXila the votive tank consists merely of a round bowl with a number of miniature saucer-shaped lamps round its rim. Three specimens only of this type have been found: two in the Bhir Mound, and one in the lowest stratum of Sirkap. They are assignable to the third and second centuries B.C.

On one side of the tank 18 a small shrine with a primitive- -looking idol of a goddess either inside or in front of it. In 4 most examples the shrine is placed on the rim of the tank, with two small posts to 44 support its front, and there is a ﬂight of steps descending from one side of it to the bottom of the tank (nos. 158—9). Generally the idol stands beside the steps about half an inch above the ﬂoor; but in one example (no. 160) the shrine itself is placed on the ﬂoor of the tank with the idol inside it. 4 Usually the shrine IS in the form of a rectangular chamber, shallow from front 4‘ to back and with or without a pillar 1n the middle of the facade. In one example, ‘ however (no. 161), which comes from stratum III, the shrine is deeper and pro- vided with a high-pitched roof; and in another still earlier example (no. 163) the 4 tank, which may have been circular, was divided by cross walls into quarters, and 4 a circular shrine was set on the dividing walls at the point of intersection. 4 ' The idols belonging to the shrines closely resemble some of the primitive ﬁgurines of the Nude Mother or Earth goddess type, with arms tapering to points at the elbows, ﬂattened bodies and no legs.

CH. 24] TERRA=COTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 465 A few other specimens of these votive tanks have also been recovered from among the ruins of Sirkap, for the most part in a fragmentary state; but as they are merely duplicates of the foregoing, it would be superﬂuous to describe them. The questions that we must now endeavour to answer are, ﬁrst, what was the signiﬁcance and purpose of these interesting tanks, and secondly” how came they to be dedicated at these stﬁpas, whether Jaina or Buddhist? One thing, clear before all else, is that they are intimately connected with the cult of the nude goddess whose shrine and miniature idol stand, in many of the specimens, on one side of the tank. Probably this was the Great Mother-goddess whose cult was ubiquitous in ancient India and went back to immemorial times. It was this same Mother— goddess, as I have elsewhere shown,I whose terra—cotta images are found at Mohenjo-daro and other sites of the Chalcolithic Age, who appears ﬁgured on the thin gold plate found by the late Dr Bloch in the heart of a prehistoric funeral tumulus at Lauriya Araraj,2 and who is carved in relief on the inner side of certain ringstones of Maurya date—themselves possessed of magic properties associated with fertility.3 Then, another obvious feature of these tanks is that they are symbolical of the four elements and of all creation: of earth, air, ﬁre and water, and of all the beings that live in them—the earth symbolised by the clay of which the tank is made, the air by the birds, the ﬁre by the lamps, and the water by the aquatic creatures within, as well as by the water itself with which the tank was partly, ﬁlled. Such symbolism calls for no recondite explanation, for there is no reason for supposing that it implies anything more than that, in the eyes of the votary, the goddess was supreme over the four elements and all created things contained in them. That, at any rate, is an adequate explanation, beyond which it is hardly necessary to go. We should not forget, however, that tanks have a certain peculiar sanctity of their own in India, partly because they are the familiar adjuncts of countless shrines and temples throughout the length and breadth of the land, partly because of the all-important part they play in the ceremonial ablutions of the worshippers. An ex-voto, therefore, consisting of a miniature shrine with a tank by its side would be a very natural and appropriate form of offering. But why—and this is the second question we have to answer—should these ritual tanks which appertained to an essentially Hindu cult, have been dedicated at Jaina or—'—if there is any doubt about them being Jaina—at Buddhist stﬁpas? The answer is to be found in the contamination which has taken place in every religion known to us, and which in the ﬁrst century A.D. was affecting Jainism as much as it was affecting Buddhism. However philosophic and abstract in their essence these two religious systems may originally have been, it was inevitable that they should take much of their subsequent colour from the primitive and long- established faiths of the people, and that, as they cast their nets wider and wider among the many nations of India and its varied classes of society, they should I See M.I.C. vol. I, pp. 49—52. 2 Cf. A.S.R. (1906—7), p. 124.. 3 See ‘Stone Objects’, ch. 25, nos. 129—32 infra.

We are not, of course, to imagine that Indian terraucottas * disappear altogether at this time. Whoever her foreign rulers might be—Maurya, Greek, Saka or Parthian—Taxila had a fundamentally Indian culture, and the articles in daily use among her people were predominantly Indian? Thus, in the second century B.C. children continued to play with the same kinds of toy carts and toy animals that they had played with in the third, and grown-ups with the same kind of dice. But the toys were no longer quite so decorative as they had been. Nowhere among them do we ﬁnd the pretty little stamped devices—rosettes, lozenges, squares and the like—of which the Maurya craftsman was so fond (e.g. Pl. 134, nos. 62 and 77). Indeed, with one small exception, the only terra-cottas from Sirkap that have any pretensions to artistic merit are the purely Hellenistic ﬁgurines such as nos. 30, 31 and 46—50. Some of these were probably produced from imported moulds, but Western inﬂuence is also apparent in locally made pieces like nos. 27, 34 and in the admirable orang—utan or gorilla, no. 53 ; and even in some of the later ﬁgurines of the ‘Nude goddess’ type, like nos. 6, 7 and 8. The exception referred to above is no. 42, which portrays a squatting kumbhdﬂda holding an animal in his left arm. This is an effective piece of modelling in the style of the later Sanchi School, and may in fact have been brought from Central India. Whatever its place of origin, it was not Taxila. Other features of a minor kind in which the Sirkap terra-cottas differ from, those from the Bhir Mound are indicated in the catalogue below. Here we need notice only the following novelties: (a) whistles (nos. 119, 120) make their ﬁrst appearance in the Greek strata of Sirkap, and coin-moulds (nos. 149~ 5 2) and small architectural pieces (nos. 1:26, 127) in the Saka~Parthian strata. (b) The circular bowl type of ritual tank (nos. 3: 53, I 54), which, is found only in the Bhir Mound and in the Greek strata of Sirkap, is replaced later bya square type, to some of which a shrine and idol of the Mother or Earth goddess typeare attached (nos. 155—63). A few small terra—cottas have also been found at the Dharmarajika and Jandial C and D sites, but they are of little interest, consisting mainly of toy animals and rattles. The following, however, are noteworthy: nos. 14 and 22, two votive rilievos in the Maurya style; nos. 45, 50 and 136, a ﬁgurine, diminutive head and medallion of Hellenistic origin; nos. I47 and 148, two moulds, one for a Buddha(?) mask, the other for a ﬁgure of Ganga(P). It remains to add a few more words about the unique groups of Buddhist terra-cottas and clay ﬁgures from the Dharmarajika, Kalawan, Mohra Moradu and Jauliaﬁ. The quality of these works of the Indo-Afghan School is variable, but the best of them take rank among the ﬁnest examples of Indian plastic art known to us, and along with their stucco counterparts I throw an entirely new light on one of the most important and vital developments in the history of Indian art. It is necessary to stress this the more, because it has been the fashion with several writers of 1 Cf. ch. 26, pp. 515 ff. Terra-cottas from Dharma- rajiki and Jandial C and D Buddhist clay ﬁgures Connexion of ritual tanks with the dead   466 TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [CH. 24 absorb into themselves many beliefs and concrete cultural practices undreamt of by their founders. In the case of Buddhism it is well known how much current folklore went to the making of the jdtakas, and if we turn to the sculptures of Bharhut and Siﬁchi—our surest and safest guides to the character of popular Buddhism in the ﬁrst century B.C.——we ﬁnd evidence on every hand of the extent to which the Sakya faith had amalgamated with the cults and superstitions of an earlier age, and become blended with them into the newer Buddhism. Thus we see in these sculptures how Lakshmi, ancient goddess of prosperity and domestic happiness, had been transformed into Maya, the mother of the Blessed One; how the magic Tree of Life and Fortune still continued to shower its blessings on the Buddhists, as it had showered them from time immemorial on their ancestors; and how yakshas and yakshis, ndgas and migis played just as real and Vital a part in the new faith as they had done in the old. It can hardly surprise us, therefore, to-ﬁnd these little shrines and tanks of the Mother-goddess dedicated by Jaina suppliants at the foot of their stﬁpas. They are only another illustration of the inevitable fusion that was taking place between the primitive cults of pre—Aryan India and a creed which was largely above the heads of the masses. The process is one which can still ‘ be seen going on in Burma, where images of the old indigenous Nats are still being set up as guardian genii round many of the Buddhist pagodas, as these small ﬁgures of the Mother-goddess were no doubt meant to protect the Taxila stﬁpas. It may be, too, that this form of votive offering had some special signiﬁcance in connexion with the dead; for the stﬁpa, be it remembered, was in origin a burial tumulus and there is no reason to suppose that its original character was ever lost, sight of. I make thissuggestion because small tanks of a somewhat similar kind to those we are discussing are still in use in Bengal in connexion with certain rites to Yama, the god of Death,” known as Yama-pukur-brata. The rites are performed by unmarried girls for four consecutive years and for a full month beginning with the last day of the month Aswin and ending with the last day of Kartik: that is, from the middle of October to the middle of November. The following is the manner of the rites. A tiny tank, about a cubit square with a channel on one side, is dug in the courtyard of the house, and on the eastern side of it are placed plants of rice, banana, turmeric, tulsi,I main,2 Italmi,3 and susni,4 all tied together in a bundle. Then a cowry, a betel nut and a piece of turmeric are placed at each of the four corners of the tank. Next, a number of small ﬁgures are made from the excavated earth, viz. a crocodile, an eel, a tortoise, a shark, sixteen dolls representing washer- men, ﬁshermen and others, and a number of crows, cranes, kites and other birds. Of these, the crocodile, shark, eel and tortoise are placed on the edges of the tank, the two latter near the channel, the birds stuck on little sticks are planted in the middle of the tank, and of the sixteen, dolls four are set on each of the banks. Thereafter, an efﬁgy of Yama is made lying in his mother’s lap, and is placed on the eastern edge beside the bundle of plants; and lastly, lamps are lit at the corners of ‘ Ocz'mum sanctum. 2 Alocasia Indica. 3 Ipomaea aquatica. 4 Marsilea quadrzfolia. \ CH. 24] TERRA—GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 467 the tank. The girls then proceed to make offerings to Yama and his mother by casting ﬂowers into the tank and pouring water therein, while they recite certain mantras, bowing down and praying for long life and prosperity for their families and themselves. When the mantras and prayers are ﬁnished, two tales are told by the girls about the powers of the Yama—pukur-brata and the evils that come to those who interfere with the ritual ;I and on the last day of the ceremonies, at the end of the fourth year, the girls give food to Brahmans, and to a cowboy they give ‘an umbrella, a piece of cloth, a pair of shoes, a stick and ten cowry shells. Here, then, in this Yama-pukur of Bengal we have all the essential features of the votive tank at Taxila, viz. the square tank of water, the creatures that live in water, the birds of the air, and the lamps of ﬁre, representing in both cases the four elements and all created things over which Yama, no less than the Great Mother—goddess, rules. A curious analogy to these votive tanks of Taxila is also presented by a class of earthenware models found in Egyptian graves of the Middle Empire, two examples of which are illustrated in P1. I 36, bl), cc. To Egyptologists they are commonly known as ‘ soul-houses ’, and the former of the two examples illustrated (no. I36, ()6) is doubtless a model of an Egyptian house intended for the soul of the departed.2 The other (cc) is more probably in the nature of an ‘ oﬁ'erings-dish’, but, with its little lamp in one corner, it can hardly fail to remind us of the tank-shrines of Taxila, albeit the resemblance may be only a fortuitous one. A closer parallel to the latter is alforded by some votive models which were found a few years ago at Hephaestia in the Isle of Lemnos and described in the Illustrated London News3 by Dr 13am Levi. These emirates (P1 136, cm), which date from the sixth century B.

That there is any immediate connexion between these tank- shrines from Hephaestia and those from Sirkap is, on the face of it, hardly probable, but it is by no means unlikely that both may go back to a common prototype which in the Chalcolithic Age may well have had a diffusion in the Near and Middle East as wide as the cult of the Great Mother-goddess herself. However this may be, there can be virtually no question that the votive tanks at Taxila were Indian in character.

Against this inference, however, there are two un- answerable arguments. The ﬁrst is that some broken tankushrines of the same kind were found by the writer as far east as Bhita near Allahabadmin the heart of Hindustan, where the Parthians never penetrated.I The second is that the idols in the tank—shrines were of a type familiar in India from prehistoric times and such as were still, in the ﬁrst century A.D., quite in keeping with popular ideas, but not such as foreign invaders from the West, whether Parthian, Scythian or Greek, are likely to have manufactured. We come now to a class of terra~cotta and clay figures which are exclusively Buddhist in character and altogether more impressive than the preceding examples. In style, they are generally similar to the Buddhist stutter) sculptures described in chapter 26, but thanks to the greater plasticity or clay as compared with stucco and to the ease with which it can be handled, many of these ﬁgures shew a freedom in their modelling and a sensitiveness to farm which was never quite attained in stucco work. With a few rare exceptions, all these ﬁgures beleng to the Indra-Afghan School of the fourth to ﬁfth century A.D., and comprise, as we shall see, several pieces of surpassing merit. The smaller ﬁgures were usually of terra-cotta throughout, that is, of clay ﬁred in a kiln. Of the larger ﬁgures, some were made entirely of sun—dried clay; in others, the head was of terra—cotta, the rest of sun— dried clay. I64. Dh. ’13—493; from building L. Terra—cotta head with high topknot and wreath. Height 5-62 in. That the Buddhists had already started making use of terra-cotta for their images even before Kushan times is evident from this head (Pl. 138, a), which comes from the Dharmarajika Stﬁpa and is so strikingly similar in size and in the character of its features— notably, in its small mouth and nose and carelessly modelled eyes—to many of the stucco heads from the apsidal temple in Sirkap, that there can be no doubt about its belonging to approxi- mately the same age (middle of ﬁrst century A.D.), though the crude treatment of the wreath and topknot suggest that it may be a little later.

How the various ﬁgures described above—Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, lay-worshippers, monks and draws—were grouped together on the walls of the stﬁpas or monasteries we have already seen well exempliﬁed in the stucco reliefs at both Mohra Moradu and Jauliaﬁ, but a still more instructive example is provided by a remarkable group at Jauliaﬁ, which was executed in clay and by a lucky chance converted into terra-cotta by a ﬁre which burnt down the monastery. This group occupied a large shallow niche (5 ft. 6 in. x 4 ft. 10-5 in.) in front of cell 29, protected from the weather by the broad veranda which ran round the four sides of the court. In the centre stands the Buddha, now headless, evidently in the abhaya attitude. To his right is a male ﬁgure of medium size wearing a tunic which reaches to his knees, trousers with buttons for lacing, a clasped and jewelled belt and a painted nap. Between this ﬁgure and the Buddha is a small female ﬁgure, clad in a long dress and ampleehawl; and,~totl1e Buddha’s left, a monk wearing a saﬁghdﬁ, with his right shoulder bare. Abeve, re the right-andleft- of the Buddha’s head and shoulders, are two dews, standing on 10111335 and leaking- down towards the Buddha. 0n the side walls of the niche were two large standing Bodhisattvas, but little of them, unfortunately, has survived. Of the ﬁgures on the back wall of the niche, the monk on the Buddha’s left is probably the abbot of the monastery, while the man wearing the conical cap and tunic is no doubt the donor of the group, and the little woman beside him, his wife. The dress and distinctive bearded face of the donor mark him clearly as a foreigner (mleccha) from the Persian side. Particularly noteworthy are his cap, laced-up trousers (or possibly leggings over the trousers) and the clasped belt which holds in his tunic round the hips. The last-mentioned was probably of gold or silver, either embossed or encrusted with gems. In true oriental fashion, the donor’s wife is represented as little more than half his size. Her dress, too, is of interest. It consists apparently of a long tunic like the Greek chitén, with a shawl (Indian sari; Greek himation) draped loosely over the left arm and shoulder and round the legs in front, leaving the tunic visible over the upper part of the body. Her ornaments consist of two bangles on each wrist, an armlet on the right arm, a heavy neck- lace, and a lighter girdle (mekhald) round her hips. Her cap appears to be provided with the characteristic Persian cheek-pieces or band which passes beneath the chin, and to be secured with cross straps fastened with a medallion in front and tied at the back of the neck. The dress worn by the celestial dew to the proper right of the Buddha is much the same as that Worn by the woman below, except that the under-tunic is so disposed as to leave the right shoulder bare and that the dew’s long wavy curls are unconﬁned by a cap.

We know now from these remains at Taxilaithat, whatever Hellenistic tradition may have lingered on into the ﬁfth century, the Indo-Afghan School was anything but a mimetic one. It was conservative to the extent that it perpetuated many of the orthodox forms ofBuddhist imagery, but it was essentially a living art, instinct with new energy and creative power, and it made most valuable contributions to the later art of Hindustan and Central India. The time when it may truly he said that art at Taxila was mainly an imitation of Hellenistic art was during the Parthian period, and we have only to turn to the stucco ﬁgures of that period from Sirkap to understand how degenerate Hellenistic art could become in the hands of Indian imitators who had no creative genius of their own. Three centuries later conditions had entirely changed: the sculptors of the Indo~Afghéin School were still making use here and there of Hellenistic motifs and ideas, but only to assimilate them into the body of their own art, which in its own way was just as original, forceful and independent as the Gupta art of Hindu— stan and more so than contemporary Byzantine art in the West.

Legs missing from hips downwards; arms end in points above the elbows; eyes are formed of round pellets with a straight horizontal 1ncision across them. Three plaits of hair fall down the back. Torques, necklaces and hip—girdle are represented by punctured dots. Crude workmanship. (Pl. 132, no. 4.) 5. Bm. ’20—829; sq. 24-48'; stratum II. Crude female ﬁgure of red terra-cotta. Height 4-37 in. Legs missing; arms end in points above the elbows; eyes as in preceding example. Long hair indicated by lines down back; torque and hip-girdle by punctured dots. Crude workmanship. (P1. 132, no. 5.) Type 1). Later ﬁgures under Graeco-Parthianinﬂuence. These come from the Parthian city of Sirkap. The modelling is inﬂuenced by Hellenistic work, but note that in no. 8 the arms end in points just below the shoulders, as they do in primitive Indian ﬁgures. On the other hand, the legs are well formed in all three specimens, and the thighs are strongly developed, as they frequently are in Indian ﬁgures, notably in the Mathura School. No. 8 is in the round; the other two are votive plaques 1n relief. 6. Sk. ’1;6—362 Block E’; sq. 75 76’; stratum II. Ex-voto relief with standing female ﬁgure, of muddy brown clay. Height 4 in. No wash or slip. Head, feet and hands missing. Arms hanging at full length on either side of body. Cf. p. 184 supra. (Pl. I 32, no. 6.) 7. Sk. ’16—594; Block 1; sq. 8-61’; stratum II.

Down the back is a plait of hair. (Pl. I 32, no. 8.) With the exception of no. 16, these ﬁgures are in relief on ex-voto plaques. That they represent divine ﬁgures there can be no doubt. In nos. 9 and I 5 no folds are visible on the draperies; in the remainder the folds are ﬁnely delineated. The nature of the lower garment is not clear. In some it appears to be a dhoti or sari; in others it is more like a skirt, while 1n one specimen it is seemingly a pair of trousers such as Pathan and Hazara women generally wear at the present day. In some specimens the arms are at full length, holding out the skirt or trousers on either side of the legs (e.g. nos. 9 and 10); in others the right or left hand rests on the hip, while the other hand hangs down (e.g. nos. I 1—15). None of the ﬁgures are later than the second century B.C. 9. Bm. ’21—I,487; sq. 49:126’; stratum II. Ex-voto plaque with standing ﬁgure of a female deity in relief. Height 4- 75 in.

Her ornaments comprise a hip-girdle (mekhald), necklaces, bangles, and rosettes on the head. The bird, which may be a dove, calls to mind a familiar type of Aphrodite. The type strikingly resembles such ﬁgures as Brit. Museum nos. B452, 458 from Naukratis or C232—52 from Cyprus; and it is noteworthy that the arms retain the Ionian attitude proper to the female sex.
