(Pl. 133, no. 30.)
31. Sk. ’28—2,789; Block K; sq. 166'44’; stratum IV. Standing male ﬁgure in the round,

wearing chitén reaching to the knees, and over it a himation covering both shoulders. Height
3-62 in. Right hand rests on the right hip and the left hand holds the edge of the himation.

CLASS IX. Standing male ﬁgure, with goat at left side (no. 32)

32. Bm. ’19—1,27o; sq. 5-62’; stratum II. Votive plaque with a standing male ﬁgure, holding
goat at his left side. Height 3- 5 in. The ﬁgure is wearing a necklace with pendants, hip-girdle
and bangles. The right hand, which is raised to the right breast, holds a rope to which the goat
is attached. Head missing. Red burnt terra—cotta.

Whether the ﬁgure is intended to be clothed or nude is uncertain. At ﬁrst sight it appears
to be nude, but in the early Indian School it was the common practice to represent the dress
as virtually transparent. Well-known examples are the yakshi's supporting the architrave of the

east gateway at Saﬁchi. (Pl. 133, no. 32.)

CLASS XI. Male and female ﬁgure standing side by side (nos. 35-8)

Type a. Many specimens of this type of votive plaque have been found in the

and is holding the side of the shawl with his right hand. The female wears a head-dress with
a topknot and long veil falling down on either side of the head; also large ear-pendants and
necklace; her left hand rests on her hip. This plaque is cast from the terra-cotta matrix
Bm. 1,55 I, which was found in the same spot along with a number of similar plaques. (P1. 13 3,
