dwarfs

450 TERRA‘COTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [CH. 24.

Type I). In another type (b) of the same subject, the woman is standing with her
right leg drawn back and her weight resting on the left leg. “

37. Bm. ’2o~~«1,o44; sq. 26-34’; stratum III. Votive plaque representing a male and female
standing side by side, the female with right leg drawn back. Height 2-68 in. She wears
a girdle round her waist and anklets. No wash or slip. Red terra-cotta. The upper half of the
plaque is missing. (Pl. 133, no. 37.)

38. Ben. ’2o~214; sq. 34'65’; stratum II. Similar. Height 325 in. The upper part is
missing. (Pl. 133, no. 38.)

CLASS XII. Pot-bellied dwarfs (kumbhanda 0r kichaka) (nos. 39—44, a)

With them may be compared the kumbhdnda dwarfs at Saﬁchi, notably on the
western gateway.

Type a. Standing

39. Bm. ’15~3 12; stratum II. Lower half of a standing dwarf of terra-cotta. Height 3-37 in.
Prominent belly with a girdle beneath. Another kumbhanda of the same type is holding a ram

in his two arms (Dh. ’14—141; stﬁpa area; I ft. below surface; height 362 in.). It is probable
that this one was doing likewise. (Pl. 133, no. 39.)

Type 6. Squatting

4o. Bm. ’21—I,54o; sq. 44-128’; stratum II. Figurine of a pot-bellied squatting dwarf
(kumbha'na'a) with wrinkled face and bulging eyes, wearing coiled head-dress, wreath(?) and
large ear-ornaments. Height 4-75 in.

It has been suggested that this type may be connected with the crouching Harpocrates, but
it seems more likely to be purely Indian. Cf. Brit. Museum, terra-cotta no. C 584; W. Weber,
Berlin Museums: Aegyptzschegriechz'schen Terrakotten, P13. 6, 7, nos. 71—80. Similar dwarfs are
among the ornaments on the dress of a terra-cotta ﬁgurine—possibly a yakshz' queen—now in
the Indian Institute at Oxford. The ﬁgurine, which is the ﬁnest work of its kind I have yet
seen, dates from the Maurya or Sunga period. (Pl. I 33, no. 40.)

41. Bm. ’21—962; sq. 39‘117’; stratum II. Height 4 in. Figure of a pot-bellied squatting
dwarf of red terra-cotta. Wears hair in two coils, one on each side of head, and heavy ear—rings.
Typical early Indian work. Cf. A.S.R. (1920), PI. XVI, 13. (Pl. 133, no. 41.) '

42. Sk. ’26—4,247; Block 1; sq. 13-47’; stratum II. Squatting kumbhanda on a cushion,
holding animal in curve of left arm. Height 3 in. He wears what appears to be a skull-cap
turned over at the brim and two long ear-pendants. The expression of the face calls to mind
the faces of Mara’s soldiers on the north gateway at Saﬁchi. In this and other similar
kumbhanda ﬁgures may be seen perhaps the prototype of the later ﬁgures of KuVera.
Cf. p. 142 supra. (Pl. 133, no. 42.)

42, a. Another example of the same kumbhdnda (height 2-12 in.) is seated cross-legged

_ instead of squatting, and holds a staff (P) in both hands (Sk. ’28—2,645; sq. 14-86’; stratum II).

Cf. p. 196 supra.

43. In yet another example the kumbhanda is squatting and holding a bird in the bend of his
left arm (Bm. ’30—165; sq. 41-119’, stratum I). Height 4-2 5 in. In this example the head and
right foot are missing. (P1. 133, no. 43.)

44. Along with the above may be mentioned a mould of a grotesque standing ﬁgure of an
old man, with bald head and wrinkled face but Without the characteristic pot-belly. It comes
from the Bhir Mound and dates from about 200 B.C. (Bm. ’20—1, 5 50; sq. 44-128’; stratum II).

Height 5-12 in. Cf. A.S.R. (1920), P1. XVI, 4. (Pl. 133, nos. 44 and 44, a.)
