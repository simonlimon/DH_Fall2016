4.72 TERRA—GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [01-1. 24

particular notice is the dreamy expressionof the eyes, the lids of which are half-closed, as they
almost invariably are in conventional images of the Buddha. The expression is one that from
time immemorial had been associated with yoga, and from the yogi type had been transferred
to that of the Buddha. Later on, in the early medieval period, it evidently came to be regarded
as a characteristic trait of the celestial devas who offered their worship and tribute to the Buddha.
Compare, for example, the devas in the Mohra Moradu stucco relief no. 30, and the terra—cotta
head from the same site no. 180. Cf. p. 381 supra;]aulidﬁ Mem. Pl. XVII, a, b. (Pls. I 38, o; 139.)

182. Jn. ’28—F 582. A youth carrying a basket of fruit and ﬂowers, from wall group in
chapel E I. Height 24-5 in. He wears trousers and a tunic which reaches to the knees and is
fastened on the left shoulder with buttons and loop knot. He may be a servant of the donor,
or possibly the donor himself, offering the fruit and ﬂowers to the Buddha, whose image, on the
right of the youth, has disappeared. Observe the long ear—lobes pierced for ear-rings, which
were once no doubt inserted. The ﬁgure is of clay which has been accidentally burnt, on the
surface only, to terra—cotta. Cf. pp. 377—8 supra and j‘aulz'dﬁ Mem. Pl. XII, 12. Among the sculp—
tures from Hadda now in the Musée Guimet in Paris is a somewhat similar ﬁgure (no. 1724.1)
holding a dish or basket of what appear to be lotus buds, but the material in that case is stucco
not terra-cotta. (Pl. 138, p.)

183. In. ’16—197, a; south—west corner of men. court. Mask of clay, probably from a ﬁgure
of Vajrapani, wearing drooping moustaches, whiskers and beard. Height 4-87 in. The features
are strongly marked and the modelling exceptionally ﬁrm and clean, showing a ﬁne appreciation
of form and line. The clay has been accidentally burntmon the surface only-40 terra-cotta.
Cf. jaulz‘dﬁ Mem. Pl. XXV, e and p. 5r, no. 4, and p.- 385 supra. (Pl. x38, 1.)

184. In. ’16~F28; mun. court. Terra-corral head of child with lips parted in smile, hair
falling over forehead, ﬁnely curved brows and chubby cheeks, the whole having a remarkably
modern look. Height 4-5 in. Covering the surface is a slip and lime-wash. Nose damaged.
Cf. jaulidﬁ Mem. Pl. XXV, d and p. 51, no. 6. With this and the following number may be
compared a small stucco head of an ‘amorino’ from Hadda, now in the Musée Guimet
(no. 172 57), though it has not quite such a laughing expression. Cf. p. 385 supra. (Pl. I 38, m.)

' 185. In. ’16—197, 12; south-west corner of quadrangle. Terra-Gotta head of child, slightly
smiling. Height 5-5 in. Three tufts of hair, one on forehead and two over ears; head-dress of
plaited ribbons, with bow on top. Socket-hole in neck for attachment—probably to a body of
clay. Traces of gilt. For the three tufts of hair, cf. ‘ Stucco Sculptures ’, ch. 26, no. 85 = Pl. 160, h,
and the centre amorino in the Gandhara sculpture no. 73, Pl. 216. Cf. jaulidﬁ Mem. P1. XXV, f
and p. 51, no. 5; and p. 385 supra. (P1. 138, n.)

186. In. ’I6—F29. Front of chapel 8. Bunch of pipal leaves belonging to the canopy over
a Buddha. 775 in. across. Octagonal socket-hole underneath, for support. Of slightly burnt
clay. For chapel 8 and its clay ﬁgures, see chapter 20, pp. 381—2.

187. J1. ’12—242; mound C; 3 ft. below surface. Head and bust of buff terra—cotta. Height
5'2 5 in. Over the hair is a bandeau with high brim attached, having the appearance of a modern
hat. Rosette in front, and two more rosettes below ears, which may be ear-pendants. Scarf
over left shoulder. Right shoulder missing; mouth and cheeks damaged. Traces of black paint
on hair. >

It should be noted that this remarkable piece is a bust only, not part of a full-length ﬁgure.
Its date is uncertain, as its form and style are unlike those of any other sculptures at Taxila.
It is probably not earlier, however, than the fourth to ﬁfth century A.D. Cf. p. 224. supra.
