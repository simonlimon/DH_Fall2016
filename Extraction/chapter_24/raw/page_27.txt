CLASS XXIII. Votive or ritual tanks (nos. I 53—63)

Among the many objects of earthenware from the Bhir and Sirkap Mounds it
remains only to describe certain small votive or ritual tanks of a kind Virtually new
to Indian archaeology. These tanks do not number more than ﬁfteen in all,
inclusive of fragments, and out of this number four were found, as already stated,I
alongside the base of the small stﬁpa in the Parthian palace of Sirkap, where they
were still evidently occupying the places where they had originally been dedicated;
a ﬁfth was lying loose in the debris near by, and two others were found in the court—
yard of the stﬁpa in Block A. As there are grounds for believing that these two
stﬁpas were Jaina rather than Buddhist structures, and as none of the tanks has
been found at any of the innumerable Buddhist stﬁpas at Taxila, it is not unreason-
able to surmise that they were particularly connected with Jaina ritual.

Earliest type a. In the earliest form represented at TaXila the votive tank
consists merely of a round bowl with a number of miniature saucer-shaped lamps
round its rim. Three specimens only of this type have been found: two in the
Bhir Mound, and one in the lowest stratum of Sirkap. They are assignable to the
third and second centuries B.C. In the Bhir Mound examples the rim is not ﬂattened;

in the Sirkap example it is.

153. Bm. ’20~I,I,67; sq. 24:60’; stratum II. Part of an earthenware votive tank in the form
of a bowl with verticalrim surmounted by tiny saucer lamps. Diam. 6° 5 in. Three out of eight

of the lamps have survived. Of red clay mixed with bajn‘. Traces of red wash. (P1. 136, t.)
154.. Sk. ’3o~312,; Block C’; sq. 52’88'; stratum V. Earthenware cup with narrow base and

four out of eight tiny lamps on its splayed and ﬂattened rim. Diam. 5-75 in. Of pinkish red
clay. (P1. 136, s.) ‘ I

Type I). In a second type, which is found only among the later remains in Sirkap,
the tank takes a square instead of a circular form; there are four instead of eight
lamps—one on each corner of the rim, and perched midWay between the lamps
are four birds with outspread wings. Inside the tank is a ﬂight of steps sometimes
set against one of the sides, sometimes standing out from it, while on the bottom
are aquatic creatures—eels, frogs and tortoises—and a low protuberance, on which,

in one example (no. 158), a bird is perched.

155. Sk. ’24—1, 526; Block K; sq. 156-49'; stratum II. From shrine in royal palace. Ritual
tankvsurmounted by small lamps at the four corners. Traces of birds perched on the rim
between the lamps, and a ﬂight of steps in one corner. Bottom broken. Of red coarse clay
