108. Sk. ’29——970; spoil earth. Similar to preceding, but of grey steatite. Length 3-37 in.

CLASS XVII. Lamps (nos. 10947)

Lamps do not appear to have been made of stone until the Saka-Parthian
period, when schist and other soft stones came into use for the manufacture of
many household utensils. No specimens of stone lamps have been found in the
Bhir Mound or in the earlier cities of Sirkap; and none of those from the Dharma-
rajika Stﬁpa can be assigned to an earlier date than the second century A.D.

The commonest shape is a leaf- or heart—Shaped vessel, sometimes provided with
a handle projecting from the back, sometimes with pierced lugs for suspension.
A few specimens are bowl—shaped or rectangular, with spouts for the wicks. The
former, and perhaps the latter also, were copied from Hellenistic prototypes.

Type a. Leaf- or heart-shaped lamps, with open reservoirs.

109. Sk. ’24—882; Block C; sq. 45-46’; stratum IV. Leaf-shaped lamp of grey schist, with
three lug-ears, pierced for suspension. Length 4:12 in. (Pl. 141, bb.) ’

1 10. Sk. ’13—1,094; Block E; sq. 74- 53’; stratum I. Similar to preceding, of micaceous schist,
with lotus-leaf design on outside. Length 462 in. Cf. p. 162, no. 8 supra. (P1. 14.1, cc.)

111. Dh. ’12—1 12; D8; 8 ft. below surface. Similar (length 4-62 in.), with Kharoshthi
inscription on outside: Taksha(s’)ilaami dhamarai'(e Dhamadasabhikskun)o (esha)saputrasa
danamukhe(o)=‘In the Dharmarajika compound of Takshas’ila this is the gift of the friar
Dharmadasa(?).’ Cf. pp. 249, 252 supra; A.S.R. (1912), P1. XIV, d; and for the inscription,
C11. 11, pp. 89—90. According to Prof. Konow, the characters are later than the silver—scroll
inscription of the year 136=A.D. 78~9 (see above, ch. 10, p. 256), but earlier than Kanishka’s
reign. The lamp may, therefore, be assigned to about the beginning of the second century A.D.
(Pl. 146, no. 111.)

112. Mm. ’15-274; central court of monastery. Leaf-shaped lamp of phyllite, with three
solid lugs at sides and back, and two small projections inside, near the lip. Length 5 in. The
outside is carved in low relief with a lotus—leaf pattern, and the rim with a rough bead moulding.
This lamp comes from the Mohra Moradu monastery and is almost certainly of the ﬁfth century
A.D. (Pl. 141, dd.) .
