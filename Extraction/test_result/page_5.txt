Cases XVIII. Bmtlshers and polishers (nos. 1 18—20)

These my have served various purposes, but it is probable that they were
chiefly used for the pnliahing of small gold and silver articles.‘ The larger kind are
fmm 2-5 tn 4. in. in length, spindle-shaped, and generally with one end more
painted than the other. They are made of sardoine, banded agate, chalcedony or
chert. But there is another and smaller type of burnisher intended for exceptionally
ﬁne work, which consists of a tiny point of agate set in a copper handle. This latter
type has been found only in Sirkap; the larger type occurs in the Bhir Mound as
well as in Sirkap.

Type a:

1x8. Bm. ’15—323; stratum II. Burnisher of impure chalcedony, blotched white and grey.
Length 4in. (Pls. 142, g; 146, no. 118.)

119, a. Sk. ’29—190; Block A’; sq. 25-88’; stratum III. Burnisher of brown sardoine.
