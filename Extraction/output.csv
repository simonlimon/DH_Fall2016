Lamps (nos. 10947) Lamps do not appear to have been made of stone until the Saka-Parthian period, when schist and other soft stones came into use for the manufacture of many household utensils. No specimens of stone lamps have been found in the Bhir Mound or in the earlier cities of Sirkap; and none of those from the Dharma- rajika Stﬁpa can be assigned to an earlier date than the second century A.D. The commonest shape is a leaf- or heart—Shaped vessel, sometimes provided with a handle projecting from the back, sometimes with pierced lugs for suspension. A few specimens are bowl—shaped or rectangular, with spouts for the wicks. The former, and perhaps the latter also, were copied from Hellenistic prototypes. Type a. Leaf- or heart-shaped lamps, with open reservoirs.",141-aa,Sk,,,1929

(1912), P1. XIV, d; and for the inscription, C11. 11, pp. 89—90. According to Prof. Konow, the characters are later than the silver—scroll inscription of the year 136=A.D. 78~9 (see above, ch. 10, p. 256), but earlier than Kanishka’s reign. The lamp may, therefore, be assigned to about the beginning of the second century A.D. (Pl. 146, no. 111.)",146-111,Dh,,,1912
