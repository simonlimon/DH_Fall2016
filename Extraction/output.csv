Numbers of vessels of this class have been found in Sirkap and later sites, and, thanks to the fact that they were used not only for toilet purposes but as convenient receptacles for the sacred relics enshrined in stfipas, many of them are still in a perfect state of preservation. Usually they are made of grey or micaceous schist, but not infrequently of steatite; only one specimen is made of phyllite. Similar caskets, almost always of steatite, had been made in other parts of India—notably in Hindustan and Central India—as far back, at least, as the Maurya period and pro- bably much earlier, but not a single specimen has been found in the Bhir Mound. The earliest—belonging to the early Saka period (ﬁrst century B.C.)—comes from the Dharmarajika. The shapes of these caskets are not many. The commonest are globular and slightly squat, like the modern lady’s pulf—box, the division between body and lid being just above the middle; others are cylindrical and tall; others cylindrical and shallow, like the Greek pyxis; others again—and these are smaller in size—have a CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 499 spherical form with a small closely—ﬁtting lid; and there is one—the earliest of all—— which is square, and another which resembles a vase with wide-open mouth.
