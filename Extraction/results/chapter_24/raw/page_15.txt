CLASS XVI. Toy animals running on wheels (nos. 61—71)

This kind of toy, which like the cart, was essentially Indian, was common on the
Bhir Mound but rare in Sirkap. The specimens from the former site include
horses, humped bulls, a ram and birds (nos. 61—71).

61. Bm. ’zo—I,619; sq. 34-39’; stratum II. Horse on wheels of red terra—cotta. Length 6 in.
Neck-band with three pendants. The head-stall comprises cheek-straps, front, face-piece and
nose—band; the plume is broken. The bridle is decorated with straps, bosses, etc. Two trans-
verse holes through fore- and hind-legs for the axle—trees of wheels. Head and hindquarters
damaged. Rosette on each side of neck.

62. Bm. ’30—963; sq. 27-49’; stratum II. Similar to preceding, with remains of plume on top
of head and tassel behind each ear. Length 4-25 in. Body decorated with stamped square
devices and small circlets. The four wheels ﬁtted to it were found on the same site (nos.
Brn. ’29~102; Bm. ’30—776, 160 and 278). The two fore- and two hind-legs were made in
one piece for the sake of stability. (P1. 134., no. 62.)

The one and only horse on wheels from Sirkap resembles the earlier specimens
from the Bhir Mound in that the fore- and hind-legs are made in one piece and
pierced with transverse holes for the axle-trees, but it differs from them in being
more truthfully modelled, though less ornamental. It has a neck—band of two
incised parallel lines with a row of dots between, and a head-stall consisting of
cheek-straps, front and face piece; but it has none of the stamped squares, triangles
or circles which characterise many of the horses and elephants from the Bhir
Mound, nor the tassels and other decorative features which in the earlier period
were so dear to the heart of the Indian craftsman.

_ 116363 for sales, and another hole through nose for string. Height 3 5 in Fitted with four
Wheels found on the same site (Bm.15677o, etc”) A tolerably well-modelled animal,
Without stamped devices or ornaments. Cf. A.S.'R. (1919), P1. XI, I 5. (Pl. 134, no. 64.)

65. Em. ’15-304; stratum II. Similar to preceding and of same date, with bands in front of
horns meeting on forehead. Length 4-62 in. (Pl. 134, no. 65.) L

66. Bm. ’15—306; stratum II. Similar to preceding, but without head-bands, and of rougher
workmanship. Length 3-75 in.

67. Bm. ’15—307; stratum II. Terra-cotta ram with two transverse holes through front and
hind—legs for axles. Length 412 in. Head damaged. (Pl. I 34, no. 67.)

transverse holes, one through the beak for a string, the other through the body for the axles.
Length 3- 5 in. Of red terra-cotta mixed with lime. (Pl. I 34, no. 68.)

69. Bm. ’24—622; sq. 31-31’; stratum II. Similar to preceding. Length 4-87 in. (P1. 134,

examples which follow, from Sirkap, have ﬂat bodies and triangular heads.
