CH. 24] TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 469

which might be thought to indicate an earlier date for this head, but the clear-cut, mobile
lips and other features leave no doubt that it is a product of the Indo—Afghan School.
Cf. p. 249 supra. (Pl. 138, b.)

166. Dh. ’1 3—1, 500; chapel G6. Bearded head of a middle-aged man, 10 in. in height, made
of well-burnt terra-cotta, not of clay converted by accidental ﬁre into terra—cotta. The hair,
which is long and taken back from the forehead, is left undeﬁned at the back of the head,
evidently because the ﬁgure was in high relief and not intended to be seen behind. The brows
are soft; the eyes large and wide open; the lips full; and the beard and the hair are shown in
relatively ﬁne strands, as contrasted with their more massy treatment in the stucco heads of the

Parthian period from Sirkap. Cf. p. 257, no. 4. supra; A.S.R. (1912—13), p. 20 (3), and P1. V, d.

(Pl. 137, b.)
167. Dh. ’13—543; chapel B12. Head of beardless youth, of well-burnt terra-cotta,

I 1-5 in. high. Tip of nose and left eye damaged. The hair falls forward over the forehead but is
brushed back at the sides of the head; the modelling of nose, lips and cheeks is more sensitive
and expressive than in the bearded head, and the eyebrows are more sharply deﬁned. The eyes
themselves, though large and open, incline slightly to the oblique, suggesting a vestige of
Mongolian strain in the model. Both this and the preceding are no doubt portraits; but of the
two, the beardless head is a more subtle and engaging piece of work and stamped with more
character than the other. The pity is that in these, as in so many other cases, only the heads
have survived. Probably it was only the heads that were made of terra-cotta, the rest being of
unbaked clay, which time and weather have inevitably destroyed. Cf. A.S.R. (1912—13), p. 14

(4), and P1. V, a. (Pl. 137, a.)
168. Dh. ’14—58 5; chapel R 1. Female head, with the hair taken back from the forehead and

a veil falling backwards from the crown of the head. Height 7-75 in. The mouth and chin are
noticeably small, the nose sharply pointed, and the eyes small and somewhat oblique, with the
pupils indicated by incised lines. The ear-lobes are pierced for ear-rings. Cf. p. 254 supra;

A.S.R. (1914.), P1. VII, a. (Pl. 138, c.)
169. Dh. ’15~950; men. court A; 8 ft. below surface. Bearded head of Brahmanical

ascetic, with strongly pronounced features. Height 7 in. The hair is taken back in coarse strands
from the forehead and coiled on the crown of the head. The eyes appear to have been inserted
in separate pieces in their sockets. The modelling of the features, though rough, is full of
vigour and there is a freedom about it which argues no little ability on the part of the artist. It
should be noted that the clay of this head is badly burnt, but the burning does not appear to

have been accidental. Cf. p. 278 supra; A.S.R. (1915), P1. III, b. (Pl. 138, d.)
170. Dh. ’12—1,9I6; chapel L. Male head, with hair taken back from forehead and remains

of bow on top of head. Height 5 in. Deep-set eyes with prominent eyeballs and heavy eyelids;
rather high cheek-bones, full ﬂeshy lips, and prolonged ear-lobes. To What class of ﬁgure this
head belonged, is uncertain. It seems safe, however, to say that it was not a personal portrait.
At ﬁrst sight the full fleshy features call to mind the stucco head, no. 78, which also comes
from the Dharmarajika Stﬁpa, but that head is a portrait head and decidedly superior in style

and execution to this one. (Pl. 138, e.) _
I71. Dh. ’13—I,452; B 16; 6 ft. below surface. Male head with moustache, wearing elaborate

Indian turban and heavy ear ornaments. Height 4- 5 in. Somewhat similar heads of stucco are
to be found among the sculptures at Jauliaﬁ and Mohra Moradu. Cf. p. 24.9 supra; A.S.R.
(1912), P1. VI, a. (P1. 138, f.)

172. Dh. ’15—1,195; mon. court A; 8 ft. below surface. Head of Bodhisattva(?) with hair
falling from ushm'sha over forehead and ending in plaited fringe, most of which is missing.
Height 6'2 5 in. Above the fringe is a ﬁllet tied in a bow. From the back of the ushzu'sha a veil
falls down the back. The eyes are large and staring; the nose and lips more than usually pro-

minent. Cf. p. 278 supra; A.S.R. (1915), Pl. III, e. (Pl. 138, g.)
