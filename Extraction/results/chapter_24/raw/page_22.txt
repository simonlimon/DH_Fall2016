CH. 24] TERRA—GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 461

More elaborate geometric designs are provided by nos. 132—4. Although not
identical, the three designs are closely akin, consisting of a series of concentric
bands enriched with beaded cable or toothed patterns and centred with a six—
petalled ﬂower or other hexagonal device.

132. Bm. ’24—585; sq. 13-58’; stratum III. Half of a bulla of grey-buff clay. Diam. 225 in.
Concentric beaded circles with cable border and hexagonal device in centre. (Pl. I 3 5, cc.)

I33. Bm. ’24—596; sq. 16- 54'; stratum III. Similar, but ornamented with beaded border
and hexagonal device in centre. Diam. 1-25 in. The outer bands of this ornament are missing.

Of pale red clay. (P1. 13 5, ee.)
I 34. Bin. ’24—279; sq. 16-59’; stratum II. Terra-cotta mould for making bullae, similar to

preceding. Diam. 212 in. Six—petalled ﬂower surrounded by beaded, toothed and cable
bands. (Pl. 135,17.)

In the following specimens, the geometric devices in the centre are replaced by
human masks or animals, the former of which look as if they might have been
copied from Greek coins or gems.

13 5. Bm. ’24—596; sq. 16- 54’; stratum III. Medallion of greyish black terra-cotta, with
human mask in centre surrounded by beaded circles. Diam. 2 in. Near the centre are two
holes, from back to front, for a thread. Slightly broken. A.S.R. (1924), P1. VIII, 0. (Pl. 135,
gg, 2-)

136. Dh. ’I3—I,7I3; G6; 3 ft. 6 in. below surface. Medallion of grey terra-cotta, with a head
in high relief. Diam. 1‘62 in. The head is shown full face with ﬂowing locks parted in the
middle. It may be a head either of Apollo or of Alexander the Great, and may well have been
copied from a contemporary Hellenistic coin type. Cf. p. 258, no. 6 supra. (P1. I 3 5, gg, 1.)

Two other medallions from the same mould were found at the Dharmarajika Stﬁpa, viz.
Dh. ’16—'78: (no. 136, a) and Dh. ’13—I,863. (Pl. 138, h, i.)

137. Bm. ’21—416; sq. 10-60’; stratum III. Bulla of red terra-cotta. Diam. 1-75 in. On
convex side, within beaded border, relief of lion killing a bull. Two holes from back to front
near centre. This is a ﬁne bit of Hellenistic relief, such as may have been imitated by the
sculptors of Stitch! when carving some of the medallions on the balustrade of the second stﬁpa,

where the same motif is to be found. (Pl. 136, a.)
138, a, b. Bm. ’z4o506, (1; sq. 16-54’; stratum III. Crescent of terra—cotta, perhaps an ear—

pendant, with beaded border. Diam. 1-25 in. Two small holes for suspension. The mould of
this, Bm. 506, b=no. I 38, a, was also found near by it. (Pl. 136, b, h.)

139. Bm. ’20-I,5Io; sq. 31-49’; stratum II. Spiraliform ear—ring of light red clay, similar in
shape to the carnelian specimen, Bm. 1,132. Size 1 x 0-68 in. (P1. 136, i.)

All the necklace beads of terra-cotta are from the Bhir Mound. There are no
specimens from Sirkap or other sites. With the exception of no. 141, all were found
in one group, the probable date of which is c. 300 B.C. Cf. ch. 37, pp. 742—3.

140. Bm. ’24—598; sq. 16- 54’; stratum III. Grey terra-cotta bead with pointed knobs all

round, rather like a mace-head. (Pl. 136, g.) 4
I41. Bm. ’24—628; sq. 30-36’; stratum II. Pyramidal pendant of terra-cotta, square in

section with vertical hole for threading. Length 0-75 in. (P1. I 36, c.)
142. Bm. ’24—602; sq. 16- 54’; stratum III. Terra-cotta pendant in the shape of a pome-

granate; a hole at base of fruit for suspension. Length 0-87 in. (P1. I 36, j.)
143. Bm. ’24—601; sq. 16-54’; stratum III. Three pendants of terra-cotta with holes for

suspension. Irregular shape, in imitation of coral. Traces of red wash. Length 1-12 in.
