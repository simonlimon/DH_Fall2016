a grey core, sometimes red throughout. The saddle—horse no. 83 is of bull-

coloured clay with traces of a thin red paint.
The horses on wheels come from the Bhir Mound only. Besides these there are

horses with harness, some with saddles, some without; and one very small

the Bhir Mound and one from the Sirkap (no. 87). In the former, the saddle,
which rose high in front and rear, was kept in positiOn by a girth—band passed over
the top, with a breast-band in front and a crupper behind. The latter is a crudely
fashioned little toy, and all that can be made out of it is that the saddle was four-
peaked, with two peaks in front and two behind, and that it was held with a crupper
behind. Cf. also no. 86, a rather better specimenof the four—peaked saddle.
