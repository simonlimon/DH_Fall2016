lamps are better preserved. Vertical steps near middle of one side, instead of in corner.

157. Sk. ’14—383; Block K; sq. 160-45’; stratum II. Similar, but with steps standing out
from side near one corner. Aquatic creatures on bottom. Coarse red clay mixed with bajrz‘.

Size 1025 x 975 in. Cf. pp. 173~4 supra; A.S.R. (1914), P1. XXII, 56.

Type c. The third type is more elaborate. On one side of the tank is a small
shrine with a primitive-looking idol of a goddess either inside or in front of it. In
most examples the shrine is placed on the rim of the tank, with two small posts to
support its front, and there is a ﬂight of steps descending from one side of it to
the bottom of the tank (nos. 158—9). Generally the idol stands beside the steps
about half an inch above the ﬂoor; but in one example (no. 160) the shrine itself
is placed on the ﬂoor of the tank with the idol inside it.

Usually the shrine is in the form of a rectangular chamber, shallow from front
to back and with or without a pillar in the middle of the facade. In one example,
however (no. 161), which comes from stratum III, the shrine is deeper and pro—
vided with a high-pitched roof; and in another still earlier example (no. 163) the
tank, which may have been circular, was divided by cross walls into quarters, and
a circular shrine was set on the dividing walls at the point of intersection.

The idols belonging to the shrines closely resemble some of the primitive
ﬁgurines of the Nude Mother or Earth goddess type, with arms tapering to points
at the elbows, ﬂattened bodies and no legs. See above Class I, a, nos. 1—5.

158. Sk. ’15—715; sq. 2 5-66’; stratum II; from court of Block A. Votive tank of terra-cotta
with a double—chambered shrine at one side. I 1-12 x 1 I in. A ﬂight of steps descends from the
shrine to the bottom of the tank, and by its side stands a female idol. Near the middle of the
tank is a low protuberance on which a bird is perched. In other respects the tank is similar to
those already described. Cf. p. 145, n. 5 supra; A.S.R. (1924—5), p. 50. (Pl. 136, w.)

159. Sk. ’15—718. From same spot as preceding, and similar to it, but the shrine is single-
chambered and the rim of the tank is scalloped. On the ﬂoor are eels or water-snakes, a
tortoise and a frog, as well as a small protuberance near the foot of the steps; 10' 5 in. square by
2.25 in. deep. Cf. A.S.R. (1924—5), p. 50. (P1. 136, x.)

160. Sk. ’15—412; Block K’; sq. 159-104]; stratum II. Similar to preceding, but the shrine
is set on the ﬂoor of the tank, and the idol is inside it; 10 x 9°75 in. Cf. p. 180.

The following are fragments only:

161. Sk. ’29—1,235; Block 1’; sq. 14-96’; stratum III. A square terra-cotta hut with pitched
roof and four steps in front. Height 4-7 5 in. Originally it was attached to the side of a ritual
tank. Cf.- p. 196 supra; A.S.R. (1915—16), Pl. VIII, a. (P1. 136, 7).)

I62. Sk. ’14—98; Block K; sq. 168,-47’; stratum II. Triangular shrine of terra—cotta
belonging to a ritual tank. Height 3-25 in. At the back, on the underside, is a sunk groove
where it ﬁtted on to the rim of the tank. Cf. p. 173 supra. (Pl. 136, y.)

163. Sk. ’29—3,178; Block A'; sq. 15-88’; stratum V. Central part of a ritual tank with
fragments of two cross-walls surmounted by a circular shrine. Length 8-5 in. This tank, which
comes from the Greek stratum in Sirkap, may have been circular, like those of type a. The
shrine is bell-shaped With an entrance on one side. Round it are the broken stumps, ﬁve in
number, of What may have been trees or pillars, and on the top of the roof is a broken pro-
tuberance, which may have been a ﬁnial. Within the shrine is another broken stump, which
looks suspiciously like a lirlga. (Pl. 136, z.)
