470 TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [CH. 24

When describing the stucco ﬁgures from Kalawan (p. 3321), I draw attention to
an unusual facial type found almost exclusively on that site, with rather short nose,
full cheeks and chin and pronouncedly curved lips. The stucco heads in question
are not of especially high—class style, but their character is so distinctive, that they
can be picked out at a glance from among the countless other specimens at Taxila.
The same observation applies to most of the terra-cotta and clay heads from the
Kalawan monasteries, only that in their case the style and workmanship is of a very
much higher order, putting them, along with the stucco reliefs of Mohra Moradu,
among the ﬁnest products of the Indo-Afghan School. '

I73. Kn. ’32—45; B20; 2 ft. 9 in. below surface. Terra-cotta head of Buddha. Height
18-1 in. Ushm'sha, forehead and left ear damaged. This is the largest head of Buddha in terra-
cotta found at Taxila, and a ﬁne example of the conventional type, distinguished by great
dignity and reserve. The clay has been intentionally, not accidentally, ﬁred. The body was no
doubt of clay. The Buddha image to which this ﬁne head belonged was the centre ﬁgure of a
group comprising nos. 174—6 as well as several other ﬁgures now reduced to fragments. For
detailed description, see pp. 337—40 supra. (Pl. I 37, d.)

174. Kn. ’32—46; from same spot as no. 173. Terra—cotta head of Bodhisattva. Height
14. in. A superb example of the modeller’s art. Wears moustache, ear-rings, elaborate head-
dress with the hair drawn back over ears. The head-dress, which is unique of its kind, is
composed of a crescent-shaped crown in front, with a turret-like erection behind. The decoration
of the crown is in imitation of encrusted jewels, With a foliate rim above and beaded border
below. The side pieces are plain. The ear-ring (there is one only, on the left side) is of a very
elaborate and unusual form, the cluster of drops being turned upwards instead of downwards.
The clay seems to have been intentionally, not accidentally, burnt. See no. I73. (Pl. 137, c
and frontispiece to this volume.)

175. Kn. ’32—43; from same spot as no. 173. Clay head of dew, with long hair waved back
from the forehead. Height 8-5 in. Ushm'sha and ears missing. The clay has been ﬁred by
accident in the conﬂagration of the monastery. See no. 173. (P1. I37, e.)

176. Kn. ’32—42; from same spot as no. 173. Clay head of monk, with shaven crown.
Height 6-4 in. Right ear missing. Traces of lime-wash. Clay only half burnt, in accidental ﬁre.
See no. 173. (P1. I37,f.)

I77. Kn. ’32—200; cell F12; ﬂoor-level. Portrait head in unbaked clay of a lay ﬁgure with
hair falling over forehead. Height 79 in. The right side of the head is damaged. Probably a
portrait of the donor of the group with his wife (no. 178), as in the Jauliaﬁ group no. I81. The
modelling has been done with an unusually free touch. Cf. p. 335 supra. (Pl. 137, h.)

I78. Kn. ’32—183; cell F12; east side; ﬂoor-level. Portrait head of a female ﬁgure of
burnt clay, with long wavy hair parted down the centre and taken back over the ears. Height
4-7 5 in. Crescent tiara on crown. Traces of lime-wash. In all probability a portrait of the wife
of the donor, no. 177. (P1. 137, i.)

179. Another image of the Buddha in the strictly conventional style comes from Mohra
Moradu. It is an exceptionally ﬁne piece of modelling and has the advantage of being un-
usually well preserved:

Mm. ’15—21; monastery. Image of the Buddha, seated cross-legged in the dhydna-mudrti,
with saﬁghdﬂ covering both shoulders. Height 20 in. The hair is taken back in waves over the
ushnisha. On the forehead, between the brows, the small ﬁmd is shown in relief. Though
formalised, the features are a shade less lifeless than is usual, and the drapery more naturalistic.
On these grounds the image might be taken to be earlier than the generality of sculptures at
