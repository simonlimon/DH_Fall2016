Toy humped bulls are not as common as might be expected on any of the
TaXila sites, and none of them, even from the Bhir Mound, are adorned with
stamped patterns. The following three types are, however, readily distinguishable,
viz.:

Type a. Of medium size with solid bodies and legs.

90. Dh. ’;I7—48 mon. court A; 3 ft. 6 in. below surface. Toy hull of red terra-cotta, with
dark red wash. Height 5 in. A bell is tied round the neck. Horns slightly damaged. The
modelling 1s better than usual in this class of toy. Cf. p. 278 supra. (Pl. I 3 5, d.)

Type 6. Of larger size, with hollow pipe-like bodies, long hollow legs and circular
hind—quarters. The clay is sometimes red, but more often brown or grey.

These toy bulls seem to have been manufactured more or less in this form in
both early and late times. In the earlier specimens the eye takes the form of a
circlet with a punctured dot in the centre. In the later it consists of a round pellet
in the centre, with a circlet around.

body and legs. Half of the body and hind-legs and left horn are missing.

a big hole at the back of the body. Tail in relief on left hind—leg. Head and three legs
m1ss1ng.

93. Dh. ’16—527; mon. court A; 2ft. below surface. Toy bull of red terra-cotta, with hollow
body and long stilted hollow legs. Height 85 in. Rope round neck; hump behind head.
Hind part and three legs missing. Cf. p. 278 supra.

94. Sk. ’12; Trench A 324; stratum II. Head of a toy bull with cable twisted round neck.

There is only one specimen of a toy camel; it comes from the Bhir Mound.
