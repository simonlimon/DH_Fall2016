Height 4-62 in. Light red clay. (Pl. 133, no. 29.)

CLASS VIII. Standing male ﬁgure in Hellenistic (Yavana) dress (nos. 30, 31)

These ﬁgures are of the ﬁrst century B.C. and ﬁrst century AD. It is possible
that they reproduce, under a classical guise, the Indian male gods of Classes VI or
VII, just as the nude female ﬁgures of Class I, I) probably reproduce the nude
Mother-goddesses of Class I, a. On the other hand, it is just as likely that these
quasi—classical ﬁgurines have nothing to do with the primitive deities of India. It
is noteworthy that no. 30 is holding what appears to be a small ﬂask in the left
hand. He may'therefore be intended forMaitreya.

Block K’; sq. I 5 5-103’; stratum III. Standing male ﬁgure in the round,

30. Sk. ’27—139;
left shoulder with right shoulder bare, and holding ﬂask in left hand.
