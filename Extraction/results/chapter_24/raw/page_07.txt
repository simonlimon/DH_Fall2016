448 TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS [CH. 24

CLASS V. Draped female deity standing, with child on left hip (nos. 23—5)

The drapery is free ﬂowing as in Class II above, and the ﬁgures are much
ornamented. The child’s face is turned to front, his legs sideways. (Nos. 23—5.)

23. Bm. ’20—1, 569; sq. 1833’; stratum II. Upper part of a votive terra—cotta plaque
representing a female ﬁgure standing, with a child on her left hip. Height 3-25 in. The skirt
of her dress ﬂows out full on either side. The upper half of the child is turned to the front; its
legs are in proﬁle. The mother wears an elaborate head-dress, heavy ear-pendants, necklace
and a tasseled, bell—like fringe on her upper garment. The child also has an elaborate head-dress,
ear—pendants and girdle. Of buff clay mixed with sand. (Pl. 132, no. 23.)

24.. Bm. ’21—376; sq. 12-59’; stratum II. Similar to preceding example, but with lower part
preserved and head of the mother missing. Height 4-25 in. Of yellowish clay. (Pl. 132, no. 24.)

25. Sk. ’3o~390; Block C’; sq. 50-90’; stratum VI. Similar to preceding but head and feet
of mother missing. Height 3-62 in. This is the only specimen of this type of votive plaque
found in Sirkap, and it is noteworthy that it comes from the Greek stratum referable to the
second century B.C. (Pl. 132, no. 25.)

CLASS VI. Standing male ﬁgure wearing dhoti, with or without
scarf. No ornaments (nos. 26, 27)

26. Bin. ’20—1,157; sq. 23-56'; stratum II. Standing male ﬁgure in relief, wearing dhoti.
Size 4-12 x 256 in. Left hand on breast; right hand holding a small vessel(?). Head and legs
below knees missing. Red clay. (P1. 132, no. 26.)

27. Bm. ’2o—I,453; sq. 30-49’; stratum 11. Standing male ﬁgure in the round, wearing
dhotz' and scarf in Indian fashion. Height 3 56 in. Head, arms and feet missing. Red clay,
mixed with sand. Note that, by a rare exception, this is in the round, not in relief. (Pl. 133,
no. 27.)

CLASS VII. Standing male ﬁgure in full Indian dress (nos. 28, 29)

28. Bm. ’21—1,487; sq. 49-126'; stratum II. Votive plaque with standing male ﬁgure in
relief. Height 4-87 in. Wears dhoti, richly broidered shawl, turban, heavy ear-pendants and
necklace. Highly ornamented but much defaced. Red clay. (P1. 133, no. 28.)

29. Bm. ’21—36; sq. 28~45’; stratum II. Similar to preceding, but lower part missing.
Height 4-62 in. Light red clay. (Pl. 133, no. 29.)

CLASS VIII. Standing male ﬁgure in Hellenistic (Yavana) dress (nos. 30, 31)

These ﬁgures are of the ﬁrst century B.C. and ﬁrst century A.D. It is possible
that they reproduce, under a classical guise, the Indian male gods of Classes VI or
VII, just as the nude female ﬁgures of Class I, I) probably reproduce the nude
Mother—goddesses of Class I, a. On the other hand, it is just as likely that these
quasi—classical ﬁgurines have nothing to do with the primitive deities of India. It
is noteworthy that no. 30 is holding what appears to be a small ﬂask in the left
hand. He may therefore be intended for Maitreya.

3o. Sk. ’27—139; Block K’; sq. 155-103’; stratum III. Standing male ﬁgure in the round,
wearing himation over left shoulder with right shoulder bare, and holding ﬂask in left hand.
