14. J1. ’13—50; Mound D; 8 ft. below surface. Votive relief with standing and draped female
deity, of red tetra-cotta. Height 2-2 5 in. Left hand on hip. Head missing. Of Maurya age.
Cf. p. 229. (Pl. 132, no. 14.)

15. Sk. ’14—266; stratum II. Outside the city wall. Votive relief of reddish yellow terra—
cotta with standing female. Height 5- 5 in. No wash or slip. The ﬁgure is wearing an elaborate
veil, which hangs down the back on either side of the head, ear-pendants, necklace and a
wide-ﬂowing garment below the waist. Cf. no. 9 supra. Of Maurya age or'earlier. (Pl. 132,
no. 15).

It is to be noted that, though nos. 14 and I 5 come from Jandial and Sirkap
respectively, they are of the same age as the Bhir Mound specimens.

16. A derivative of the foregoing type may be a terra-cotta ﬁgurine in the round found in
Sirkap. (Sk. ’12; Trench A 285; stratum II; height 3-87 in.) with head, right hand and legs
missing. At ﬁrst sight, this ﬁgure, which is unique at Taxila, looks as if she was seated cross-
legged. In reality, however, she is standing with her skirts Wide spread, the legs being broken
off short. The left hand is turned upwards and holds some uncertain object. (Pl. 132, no. 16.)

CLASS III. Female deity standing, with bird in left hand and
wearing tight skirt (nos. 17—19)

Her veil and braided hair fall from the crown on either side of the head. Her
ornaments comprise a hip—girdle (mekhald), necklaces, bangles, and rosettes on the
‘head. The bird, which may be a clove, calls to mind a familiar type of Aphrodite.
The type strikingly resembles such ﬁgures as Brit. Museum nos. B452, 458 from
Naukratis or C232—52 from Cyprus; and it is noteworthy that the arms retain the
Ionian attitude proper to the female sex. Possibly the type may go back to an
Ionian (Yavana) tradition introduced into the Panjab during Achaemenid times.
Cf. Naukratis I, P1. 11, nos. 1 and 2, Pl. XIV, no. 8.
