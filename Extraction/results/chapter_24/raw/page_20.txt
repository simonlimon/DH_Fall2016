CLASS XVIII. Rattles (nos. 108—18)

The commonest kind of rattle found at Taxila is in the form of a bird, and all
the early rattles from the Bhir Mound site are of this type. Other rattles (from
Sirkap and later sites) take a quasi-human or animal form, or are made to simulate
the pomegranate fruit or vases.

. 108. Bm. ’21—I,605; sq. 41-123’; stratum II. Toy rattle in the form of a dove, of red terra-

cotta. Length 35 in. (Pl. 135, o.)

comb. Height 462 in. Each leg modelled separately. Tail missing. (Pl. 135, p.)

I Observe that in both of these Bhir Mound examples the legs are separate one
from the other, not as in the Sirkap and Dharmarajika examples below, where they
are combined to form a solid round base.
