CH. 24.] TERRA-GOTTA AND CLAY OBJECTS 443

nos. I and 3 probably represent a series of anklets, like those so commonly found on female
ﬁgures at Saﬁchi‘. (Pl. I32, no. 2.)

3. Bm. ’30—290; sq. 51.117’; stratum II. Lower portion of a female ﬁgure. Height 4-5 in.
Pointed legs ending at the ankles. Hip-girdle, anklets and sex organ represented by incised
lines. Red clay. (Pl. 132, no. 3.) .1

4. Bm. ’30—444; sq. 11-61’; stratum II. Crude female ﬁgure of red térra-cotta. Height
4-37 in. Legs missing from hips downwards; arms end in points above théfelbows; eyes are
formed of round pellets with a straight horizontal incision across them. Three plaits of hair
fall down the back. Torques, necklaces and hip—girdle are represented by punctured dots.
Crude workmanship. (Pl. I 32, no. 4.)

5. Bm. ’20—829; sq. 24-48'; stratum II. Crude female ﬁgure of red terra—cotta. Height
4-37 in. Legs missing; arms end in points above the elbows; eyes as in preceding example.
Long hair indicated by lines down back; torque and hip—girdle by punctured dots. Crude

Type 1). Later ﬁgures under Graeco-Parthian inﬂuence. These come from the
Parthian city of Sirkap. The modelling is inﬂuenced by Hellenistic work, but note
that in no. 8 the arms end in points just below the shoulders, as they do in
primitive Indian ﬁgures. On the other hand, the legs are well formed in all three
specimens, and the thighs are strongly developed, as they frequently are in Indian
ﬁgures, notably in the Mathura School. No. 8 is in the round; the other two are
votive plaques in relief.

6. Sk. ’16—362; Block E’; sq. 7 5-76’; stratum II. Ex-voto relief with standing female ﬁgure,
of muddy brown clay. Height 4 in. No wash or slip. Head, feet and hands missing. Arms
hanging at full length on either side of body. Cf. p. 184 supra. (P1. I 32, no. 6.)

7. Sk. ’16—594; Block 1; sq. 8-61’; stratum II. Ex-voto plaque with standing female ﬁgure,
of greyish black terra-cotta. Height 4-2 5 in. Head and legs below knees missing. Right hand
raised to waist. Left hand on hip. Cf. p. 142 supra. (Pl. 132, no. 7.)

8. Sk. ’I4~89; Block K; sq. 161-62’; stratum II. Standing female ﬁgure in the round of

red terra-cotta. Height 3-62 in. Head and feet missing. Arms end in points below shoulders.
Down the back is a plait of hair. (Pl. 132, no. 8.)

CLASS II. Female deity standing, with full-ﬂowing skirt (nos. 9—16)

With the exception of no. 16, these ﬁgures are in relief on eX-voto plaques. That
they represent divine ﬁgures there can be no doubt. In nos. 9 and I 5 no folds are
visible on the draperies; in the remainder the folds are ﬁnely delineated. The nature
of the lower garment is not clear. In some it appears to be a dhoti or sari; in others
it is more like a skirt, while in one specimen it is seemingly a pair of trousers such
as Pathan and Hazara women generally wear at the present day.

In some specimens the arms are at full length, holding out the skirt or trousers
on either side of the legs (e.g. nos. 9 and 10); in others the right or left hand rests
on the hip, while the other hand hangs down (e.g. nos. I 1—15). None of the ﬁgures
are later than the second century 3.0.

9. Bm. ’2I—I,487; sq. 49-126’; stratum II. Ex-voto plaque with standing ﬁgure of a female
deity in relief. Height 4-7 5 in. Pinkish red terra-cotta. Figure wears Wide trousers( P) and veil
hanging from the top of the head down the back and to each side, as in no. I 5. Both arms are
at full length and symmetrical. (Pl. 132, no. 9.)
