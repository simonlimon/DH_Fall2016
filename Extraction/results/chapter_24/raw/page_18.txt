elephantvwas the more favourite toy in the Maurya period at T axila, the horse was
more fashionable under the Greeks, Sakas and Parthians.

In the Bhir Mound examples, the head—stalls are composed, like the Indian
head~stalls of this period in Hindustan and Central India, of vertical cheek—straps
and face—strap with horizontal front- and nose—bands, and sometimes an extra
strap between the front- and nose-bands. Thus, in these early examples, the straps
making up the head-stall were either vertical or horizontal. In the later examples
from Sirkap, on the other hand (e.g. nos. 88 and 89), there are usually cross-straps
running obliquely from the middle of the face-strap to the ends of the bit. At the
junction of the straps in both earlier and later types there is commonly a boss,
medallion or rosette. For head—stalls at Saﬁchi, see Maisey, Sdﬁchi and its Remains,
Pl. XV, figs. 14 and 15. In the true Indian harness, plumes were almost invariable,
both for riding and driving horses. Even in the toys, plumes are very commonly
shown, not only in the, earlier specimens from the Bhir Mound but in the later ones
from the Greek, Salsa and Parthian settlements in Sirkap. '

Observe that in no. 82-~a large hollow toy—there is a ﬂy—whisk of loOse. leather
straps hanging from the middle of the front band. In this specimen the eye is
formed of a small applied circlet with a hole in the middle. In no. 84 the, eye is
formed of a round pellet crossed bya straight incision. In the later examples from
Sirkap the eyes are twice or thrice as large, and are generally worked up or incised '
in the body of the clay; in some cases, however, they are applied. Let it be
added that the Sirkap heads usually have a transverse hole through the mouth for
a string.
