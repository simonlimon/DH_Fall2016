614 SILVERWARE [CH. 29

Kharoshthi inscription of six letters, of which three only are legible, viz.: .ma ya. .sa. From
same ﬁndspot as no. 6 (q.v.). Cf. p. 162 (20) supra. (Pl. 187, no. I 5.)

16. Sk. ’13—194/2; Block E; sq. 77-66’; stratum II. From the same hoard as the Dionysus
head no. 21. Silver spoon with handle terminating in cloven hoof and attached to the spoon
by a rat-tail ridge. Length 637 in. This pattern of spoon was fashionable in the Hellenistic
world from about 300 B.C. onwards, and a favourite one in Italy in the ﬁrst century AD. This
one may either have been imported from the Mediterranean or copied from a Graeco-Roman
model. Cf. the copper spoons nos. 312, 313; A.S.R. (1912), p. 26, no. 2 and Pl. XX, i. For
other objects from the same hoard, see pp. 159—60 supra. (Pls. 187, no. 16; 189, no. 16.)

17. Sk. ’26—4,o81/I6. From the same hoard as no. 1 (q.v.). Silver spoon with plain straight
handle terminating in knob. The bowl of the spoon is shovel—shaped and very shallow.
Length 625 in. Cf. p. 157 (26) supra; A.S.R. (1926), p. 115, no. 16. In the same hoard was
also found the broken handle of another silver spoon terminating in a leaf (length 287 in.).
(Pls. 187, no. 17; 189, no. 17, a, 1).)

CLASS IX. Strainers (nos. 18, 19)

18. Sk. ’26—4,o81 /18. From same hoard as no. 1 (gm). Circular strainer, with broad ﬂat
rim furnished with ring-handle. Diam. 675 in. Cf. p. 157 (27) supra; A.S.R. (1926), p. II 5,
no. 9 and P1. XXVII, 7. For earthenware strainers, see ‘Pottery’, ch. 23, Class XVIII, type b,
and for examples in silver, Dar. et Sag. I, p. 1331, s.v. ‘Colum’, and RM. Cat. of Silver Plate,
nos. 129, 146. (Pls. 187, no. 18; 189, no. 18.)

19. Sk. ’26—4,081/19. From same hoard as preceding. Basket—like strainer of silver, ﬁtted with
ring-handle on either side. Height 512 in. On the outside, just below the rim, is a Kharoshthi
inscription: Gomanada-putras(y)a jhan'idanamas(y)a= ‘(Property) of Jhamdanama, son of
Gomanada.’ Cf. p. 157 (28) supra; A.S.R. (1926), p. 115, no. 7 and P1. XXVII, 5; and for the
inscription, 011. II, pt. I, p. 99 (5) and P1. XIX, 5. The strainer is evidently a silver imitation
of the kalathos or basket used in Greece and elsewhere for the straining of milk, etc. Also
known as ﬁeués, oxoivwos, or \‘JNOTﬁp. Observe, however, that the plaiting is merely imitation
in thin silver relief. Cf. Dar. et Sag. 3.7). ‘Calathus’, ﬁg. 1003. (Pls. 187, no. 19; 189, no. 19.)

CLASS X. Lia's for large open-mouthed vessels (no. 20, a, [2).
Cf. ‘Pottery’, ch. 23, Class XXVII, b

20, a, b. Sk. ’26—4,o81/22; stratum III. From same hoard as preceding. Two circular
concave lids of silver. Diam. 8-5 in. In the middle of the concave upper side is a looped handle
in the form of a ﬁsh soldered, apparently with copper, to the lid. Cf. p. 157 (29) supra; A.S.R.
(1926), p. II 5, no. 10 and P1. XXVII, 8. For concave lids of earthenware, see ‘Pottery’,
nos. 186—92, types a—c. (Pls. 187, no. 20; 189, nos. 20, a, b.)

CLASS XI. Miscellaneous (nos. 21, 22)

21. Sk. ’13—-194/1; Block E; sq. 77-66’; stratum II. From same hoard as no. 16 (q.v.).
Head of Dionysus or Silenus, in silver repoussé, with stand beneath. Height 3-75 in. The relief
of the head is 1-25 in. deep; the metal is extremely thin and brittle, and there is a break near
the right ear and at the base of the rim. The head of the god is bald on top and wreathed with
a grape-vine. His ears are pointed. In his right hand he holds a two—handled wine—cup
(kantharos). Behind his head passes the curved staff (thyrsos), with a bell suspended at its end.
The front of the stand is adorned with a conventional palmette, and a rosette beneath; behind,
is a curved ‘thumb—piece’ which enabled the head to be set in a slanting position on the table.
The stand closely resembles the handle of a kylix and was probably made for that purpose.
For the form of the stand, cf. Schreiber, Alexandrinische T oreutik, ﬁgs. 52—4, 60, 61, 71, etc.
