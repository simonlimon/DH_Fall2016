The ‘surfaces between the two stones, instead of being curved, slope downwards in a straight line to the outside; there is a projecting boss on the upper stone round the central hole, and towards this boss the top surface of the upper stone has a gentle slope. This mill is also made of Taraki grey sandstone and has a slightly bigger diameter (16-62 in.) than no. 27, but it is provided with a socket—hole for one handle only. Possibly the changes introduced in the shapes of the stones and other details had tended to reduce the friction and so lessen the labour. (Pls. 140, l; 143, h.)",,Sk,,1914
29,36,57,B, IV. Mullers (nos. 19—26),"29. The third grinding-mill illustrated on P1. 14.0 is of a heavier type. It comes from the Pippala monastery (Pl. ’21—38) and probably dates from the ﬁfth century A.D. In diameter (13 in.) it is smaller than the two preceding examples, but the stones are more ponderous, and it is made of hard dark grey quartzite instead of the softer sandstone. Three other noticeable differences are: ﬁrst, that the surface of the nether-stone is concave (instead of straight, as in no. 28, or convex, as in no. 27); secondly, that crossing the upper stone from side to side is a deep groove into which a stout piece of wood could be ﬁxed horizontally, with a handle projecting on either side; thirdly, that the hole in the nether-stone into which the centre pivot was ﬁxed is not pierced through the entire thickness of the stone but sunk to rather less than half its thickness. (Pl. 140, m.) Type I). Crushing-mills. This type of mill, which was also introduced at Taxila during the Saka—Parthian period, was designed probably for the crushing and grinding of harder substances (e.g. chunam) than ordinary grain. It is made of hard quartzite instead of sandstone ; the diameter is smaller (about I 1 in. only) ; the nether— stone is conical at the top ; and the upper stone takes the form of a deep heavy cylinder, concave below so as to ﬁt on to the top of the nether-stone, and with a funnel-shaped hole above. Across its top is a deep groove, as in no. 29, to take the wooden handle- piece, the latter being pierced with a hole in its centre into which ﬁtted the iron pivot of the nether—stone. 3o.

Similar, of quartzite (height 16- 5 in.; diam. 11-5 in.), with iron pivot still attached to nether-stone, but in this specimen the nether-stone is not so high as in no. 30. Vessels made of stone are relatively few in the earlier Bhir Mound cities and are restricted to those of simple shapeswmortars (with pestles), dishes, saucers, bowls and cups. The stones used for them are the hard alm' (lower cretaceous shell lime— stone) and hornblende—gneiss, soft steatite and alabaster, and the semi-precious rock crystal and agate. Of alabaster there is only one eXample—a saucer of pinkish- white colour, no. 42. AIM and hornblende-gneiss were used during this early period for pestles and mortars; abrz' also for cups and bowls; steatite (soapstone) for bowls and dishes; crystal for little toilet-trays; and agate for ornamental bowls, of which there is only one example. These stones were usually turned on the lathe, but sometimes ground down by hand. _ , Schist, as already indicated, was not introduced at Taxila until after the advent of the Bactrian Greeks (c. 190 B.C.); but from that time onwards this soft stone CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 489 came more and more into vogue, ﬁrst for simple articles like dishes and carved toilet—trays, but later on for a multitude of vessels and sculptures of all sorts. The earliest objects made of this stone are the two lathe—turned dishes nos. 38 and 39, and the two ornamental toilet-trays nos. 62 and 63 ,‘ all four of which are referable to the second century B.C. Later on, in the ﬁrst century A.D., we ﬁnd schist being used for vases of many shapes, goblets, caskets, ladles and lamps, besides unguent- bottles and elaborately carved toilet-trays. The three kinds of schist employed for these articles are the common grey schist of Gandhara, and a micaceous and hornblende schist from the same region; quartz mica—schist and the deep green chloritised mica-schist, favoured at this period by the sculptors of the North-West, were not used for household articles. Other soft stones employed during this period were steatite, phyllite, slate, clay-a stone and alabaster, but so far as Sirkap is concerned, no household objects made of these stones have been found in strata earlier than the Parthian, and even then their use is restricted to a few articles—mainly toilet—trays and caskets. Specimens made of phyllite, slate, claystone and alabaster are very few; those of steatite are not so rare. During the Kushan period phyllite, as we shall see, was to become the favourite stone for sculpture, and other objects were to be made from it as well as from the other soft stones named above, which continued in use up to the early medieval period. With the introduction of schist for household vessels in the second century B.C., hard stones like gneiss and hornblende gradually ceased to be used for this purpose. . Apart from pestles and mortars, for which particularly hard Varieties of stone are needed, only one example (no. 43) of a hard stone vessel has been/found in Sirkap, and there is reason for believing that this was a survival from one of the earlier settlements. , In regard to the use ‘of agate for small, bowls, cups, caskets, etc., the fragments of these vases found at Taxila correspond very closely with Pliny’s description of the ' famous vast: myrrhine, which fetched such big prices at Rome. Pliny alleges that these vases came from Parthia and Carmania, but no importance need be attached to his statement, because, up to the time when the Red Sea route was opened up, the carrying trade between India and the West was exclusively in the hands of the Parthians, and it is hardly likely that the precise provenance of some of the goods , would be known to the Romans.I The manufacture of agate vases is an age-old industry in‘India, especially in Kathiawar and round about the gulf of Cambay, and there can be little doubt that it was from there that the Parthian merchants exported them to Italy. On the strength of a line of Propertius,2 it has been inferred (e.g. Ramsay and Lanciani, Manual of Roman Antiquities, p. 497), that the myrrhine vases must have been some sort of porcelain, but the foci referred to by Propertius were not ordinary kilns but the special trenched kilns in which it was the Indian practice to roast agates and carnelians in order to bring out their colours. This process of burning agates was fully described by Barbosa as far back as I 517. Cf. Sir G. Watt, Commercial Products of India, p. 561, and Schoff, Periplus, pp. 193—4..

Besides this impOrtant series of toilet—trays there are a few miniature trays of rock-crystal, emanating from the Bhir Mound, which in all probability were also meant for the toilet table, and a larger tray of hornblende micaceous schist from Sirkap, which was used no doubt for household purposes. Type a. Toilet—trays. The ornamental toilet—trays are made of schist, steatite, indurated claystone, slate or phyllite. Of the thirty—three specimens described below, thirteen are of grey schist, eleven of micaceous schist, ﬁve of steatite, two of indurated claystone, one of slate, and one of phyllite or phyllitic slate. No. 64, which is probably of the Saka period, is of steatite, but with this exception all of pre—Parthian date are of schist. The subjects portrayed in these toilet-trays are not numerous.

In point of style no. 62, which comes from the Graeco— Bactrian city, has a distinctive character of its own, which apart from its place of ﬁnding would justify us in assigning it to the second century B.C. Instead of this tray being divided up, as nearly all the later examples are, into two or more compartments, the two ﬁgures occupy the centre of the ﬁeld and stand out with effective simplicity against the plain background. The ﬁgures themselves are treated almost as if they were in the round, rather than in relief,3 and the modelling of their forms, albeit sketchy, 1 The same subject is also represented on the lid of the vessel no. 106 infra. 2 E.g. Flinders Petrie, Objects of Daily Use, Pl. XXXIV, nos. 23—31. 3 This characteristic of most Hellenistic relief work is shared also by the reliefs round the abacus of the Asoka capital at Sarnath, which, as I have shown elsewhere, was executed by a Greek or a I’erso~Greek artist of the third century B.C. Cf. C.H.I. vol. I, p. 621, and Marshall and Foucher, The Monuments of Sdﬁchi, pp. 87, 88. M '1‘ 63 494 STONE OBJECTS [011. 25 is mgre conscientious than in the later trays. There is a certain distinctiveness, also, about the style of no. 63, which dates probably from the ﬁrst century B.C. and reﬂects the increasing decadence of Hellenistic art under Saka rule. The scene is of course a purely Greek one, and, although the ﬁgures individually are crudely modelled and stiff and wooden in their poses, their composition still reﬂects the older Hellenistic tradition. In no. 65, on the other hand, we recognise the effect of the Graeco- Roman art popularised at TaXila under Parthian rule, with its more crowded ﬁgures, and much greater freedom of composition and drawing; and we are on quite safe ground in referring to the same century (ﬁrst century A.D.) nos. 64, 66 and 76. But, apart from these few specimens, it is diﬂicult to determine the respective ages of these toilet-trays on the strength of their style alone. This difficulty arises from the fact that, with the passing of the Bactrian Greeks and coming of the Sakas, Hellenistic art in India rapidly declined, but revived again in the ﬁrst century under the rule of the Parthians, and though in the interim Hellenistic art: in Western Asia had to some extent been Romanised and undergone considerable changes in consequence, nevertheless it is often impossible to determine whether a particular example of debased Indo~Hellenistic work was executed before or after the Parthian revival. And this is true not only ef these stone carvings but of other branches of art as well. To be sure, the Indianised treatment of the couple in no. 70, so strongly reminiscent of the Mathura School, enables us to relegate this particular piece with conﬁdence to Parthian times, but it is not often that we get such light from the Indian side. Take, for example, nos. 78, 79 and 82. We infer from their ﬁndspots that they probably belong to the Saka period, but from their style alone it would be impossible, in the present state Of our knowledge, to afﬁrm that they were not strays from the Parthian level above. In regard to Graeco-Roman toilet-trays from Egypt, 21 paper by Sir John Evans in Proc. Soc. Antiq. (13 Feb. 1908) may be consulted, and also Flinders Petrie, Objects of Daily Use, ch. X, pp. 37—9, where he summarises whatever had then (1927) been published about these trays, their types and purpose.",,Sk,2,1916

Abri, which is a lower cretaceous shell limestone of a variegated chocolate and yellow colour, is abundant in the Hazara and Attock districts, and in Mughal times was destined to become a favourite stone for the inlay-work on buildings and pavements. At Taxila it was used for bowls, cups or dishes, but is found only in the Bhir Mound settlement up to about 200 B.C. Many of the other hard stones, such as basalt, quartzite, hornblende, hornblende-gneiss, gneiss, granite, dolerite and basanite, were obtainable in the form of pebbles from the beds of the neighbouring Tamra nala or Haro river, where the writer has himself picked up specimens of most of them, as well as of sandstone, marble and jasper. A few of those found in these torrent—beds to-day may, no doubt, have found their way there from the ancient settlements now crumbled to ruin on their banks, to which they were perhaps brought from afar in days gone by, but most of them have certainly been washed down from the distant highlands on the east. Other stones such as blue serpentine, green diorite and black Lydian, of which there are only one or two specimens at TaXila, may have come from remote localities which it is now hardly possible to identify. Of the semi—precious stones, rock-crystal, agate and chalcedony are found in so many localities in India that it is impossible to say whence the lapidaries of Taxila obtained their supply. Rock crystal, which is a form of silica or quartz, occurs in Kashmir and in the red marls of Mari in the .Mianwali district of the Panjab, but some of the best crystal nowadays comes from Tankara in the Kathiawar peninsula or from the bed of the Godivari in Madras. It is also found at Aurangpur, near Delhi, Simbhalpur, Morvi, and other places. The ﬁnest agates (and some of the agates from Taxila are unusually ﬁne), together with the closely allied chalcedony, come from the Ahmadébﬁd and Kaira districts of Bombay, from Kathiawar and from the Rﬁjpipla State, where agate—jasper is also found in company with them. Other sources of agate-jasper are the beds of the Kistna, Godavari and Bhima' rivers, but the Taxila stones are more likely to have come from the Rajpipla hills. Good agates are also obtained from north of the Pangong Lake in the Rudok district of Kashmir, from the Rajmahal hills and from the beds of the Narbada and Goda- varI rivers. The main centre at which agates, chalcedony and carnelians are now out and polished is Cambay, but the industry exists also at Jabalpur and other places within reach of the amygdaloidal Dekhan trap. In the ﬁrst century A.D., when the Periplus of the Erythmacm Sea was written, the principal market for the export of these stones to the Western world was at Barygaza, the modern Broach, whither some were brought from Ujjayini (Ujjain), others no doubt from the Kathiawar peninsula or from the Rajpipla State; and it seems highly probable that many stones from these sources found their way up the Indus to Taxila. Small Vessels made of agate were in vogue there, particularly during the Parthian domina— tion, and it is noteworthy that Pliny attributes vessels of this class, for which large prices were paid at Rome, to Parthia and Carmania, the fact being that at the time when Pliny wrote the trade was still mainly in the hands of the Parthians, who had MT 61 Semi-precious stones , .5 warm mus v“,     €31.25] STONE OBJECTS 495 The ﬁgures are clad in the Greek chiton and himation. In the lower register, seven lines sug- gestive of a palniette. On rim, beaded border in low relief. This toilet-tray is referable to the ﬁrst century 13.0., when Hellenistic art was becoming barbarised under the rule of the Sakas. Observe that the ﬁgures in this scene are more widely spaced than in the later Parthian reliefs, in this respect being nearer to the Hellenistic tradition, in spite of their stiff and rigid formality. The wig—like treatment of the hair and the wide—open, prominent eyes are peculiarly characteristic of nascent Gandhara sculpture during the late Saka period. These traits are well exempliﬁed also in nos. 70, 74 and 75, and in ‘Stone Sculptures’, ch. 36, nos. 3, 4, 12, I3, etc. Cf. p. 693 infra.

Numbers of vessels of this class have been found in Sirkap and later sites, and, , thanks to the fact that they were used not only for toilet purposes but as convenient receptacles for the sacred relics enshrined in stﬁpas, many of them are still in a perfect state of preservation. Usually they are made of grey or micaceous schist, but not infrequently of steatite; only one specimen is made of phyllite. Similar caskets, almost always of steatite, had been made in other parts of India—notably in Hindustan and Central India—fas far back, at least, as the Maurya period and pro- bably much earlier, but not a single specimen has been found in the Bhir Mound. The earliest—belonging to the early Saka period (ﬁrst century B.C.)—comes from the Dharmarajika. The shapes of these caskets are not many. The commonest are globular and slightly squat, like the modern lady’s puff—box, the division between body and lid being just above the middle; others are cylindrical and tall; others cylindrical and shallow, like the Greek pyxis; others again—and these are smaller in size—have a WWWWW ,www.mwwmmféxswwi-zwgwmnwwai‘         on, 25] STONE OBJECTS 499 spherical form with a small closely-ﬁtting lid; and there is one-«the earliest of all—- which is squarefand another which resembles a vase with wide-open mouth.

Four specimens of these singularly interesting stones have been found at T axila—three in the Bhir Mound and one in the second stratum of ' Sirkap, but the style and workmanship of the latter leave’no room for doubt that it belongs to the same (Maurya) age as the others. The peculiar sanctity with which ring-stones are invested in India is well known and can be traced back to an immemorial age. Large numbers of them, dating from the fourth or third millen- nium B.C. have been unearthed at Mohenjo—daro and Harappa—some no bigger than a ﬁnger-ring, some so large that it takes half a dozen men to lift them; while among famous examples of to-day may be mentioned the Srigundi stone at Malabar Point near Bombay, which is believed to purify those who crawl through it of disease and sickness, and the equally potent one at Satrunjaya, the hole in which is known as muktdwdra=‘door of absolution’———the door which gives happiness to anyone who can creep through it.

A disk of terra-cotta bearing an image in relief of a ‘ Fertility goddess ’ was unearthed by me at Bhita in 1911—12, and is published in my Report for that year.4 It belongs to the Kushan or Early Gupta period and depicts the goddess with legs wide apart and with a lotus (emblem of birth) issuing from her neck in place of her head.

Jade, comprising both jadeite and the nephrite variety, comes from the well—known mines in the Karakash valley of Eastern Turkestan ;2 nephrite jade is also found in Rewah State in Central India, and jadeite in the Tunga valley of the Pamirs and the Myitkyina district of Northern Burma. The few specimens unearthed at Taxila are more likely to have come from Eastern Turkestan, the Pamirs or Rewah State than from so far aﬁeld as Upper Burma. Of lapis-lazuli, the chief source has long been the Kokcha valley of Badakshan in Northern Afghanistan, but this stone is said vaguely to occur also in ‘ Tartary ’, Tibet and China. Turquoise was imported from Persia, where it is still quarried near Nishapur in the Khorasan Province near Kerman, and Karik, and near Mashiz.3 Amethysts are found in the Santal Parganas of Bihar and Orissa and at several spots in the Bashahr State on the Upper Sutlej ; they occur also occasionally in the Dekhan trap. But the ﬁnest specimens come from the gem-gravels of Ceylon. Garnets are found in mica schists at various places in Rajputana, notably at Rajmahal ' in Jaipur State, Sarwar in Kishengarh, Ajmer and Bhilwara; they are also found in the Darjeeling district, Sikkim, Hyderabad State and at numerous localities in the Madras Presidency. Beryl and aquamarine, which occur commonly in the granite peg- matites of India, are nowadays obtained at Padiyur in the Coimbatore district and at Vaniyambadi in the Salem district of the Madras Presidency, at Punnata in the Mysore, and in the Toda hills of the Jaipur State in Rajputana. They are also known to occur in the Nellore district of Madras and in the Hazaribagh district of Bengal. The stone to which I have given the name of porcelain-agate, because of its remarkable resemblance to porcelain, is new to geology. It is found at Taxila only in the form of round ﬂat disks, evidently used for some kind of inlay-work during the Maurya period. The disks vary from 2~3 in. in diameter, and 0-1 to 0-2 in. in thickness. The stone, which is banded, appears on one side like an opaline chal- cedony, on the other, which is brilliantly polished, as an opaque glass-like porcelain. When ﬁrst examined by experts of the Indian Geological Department, the material was taken to be an artiﬁcial porcelain, but further research has left no doubt that it is a natural stone produced, possibly in a volcanic region, by the long-continued heating of ordinary quartz. The speciﬁc gravity and chemical analysis of this stone, as well as the results of its microscopic examination, are discussed below (pp. 50 5—6). ‘ See Schoff, Periplus of the Erythman Sea, pp. 193—4. 2 Cf.

To the former class belong the thin disks of porcelain-agate referred to on pp. 478—9 above. As there explained, these disks vary in diameter from 2 to 3 in., and in thickness from 0-1 to 0-2 in., and are polished only on the upper porcelain-like surface, not on the under— surface, which resembles opaline chalcedony. They come from the top strata of the Bhir Mound and from Sirkap, and are referable to the third and second centuries B.C.I Cf. p. 188 supra. In View of the unusual character of this porcelain-agate, hitherto unknown to geology, it is desirable to give here the results of the examination made by Prof. H. Ii. Baker at the Royal College of Science, South Kensington. An air—dried sample ﬁelded the following analysis:          % , , 98'40 * , Gains and alumina 0'99 1 Lime :1 0-12 Magnesia 0-05 This corrsapunda very closely to an analysis of natural quartz, and the micro- scopic exanﬁnation made by the Department of Geology points “to the same conclusion, though no specimen of quartz has yet been found in a natural state which has the same peculiar arrangement of crystals. Prof. Baker endeavoured to reproduce the material by heating quartz for three months in an electric furnace to about the highest temperature of a furnace which would have been available in early times. This, he says, gave an opalescent material, which, however, was not identical microscopically with the sample of porcelain-agate examined. The quartz of these disks could not have been fused, since the substance has a speciﬁc gravity of 2-64, identical with that of natural quartz, compared with 2-38, the speciﬁc gravity of melted quartz. On fusion in the oxyhydrogen ﬂame a fragment ﬁrst splits like ordinary quartz, and then fuses. 1 Their reference numbers are: Bm. ’19—1 17 (sq. 12-28’; stratum I); Bm. ’21~966 (sq. 34-118’; stratum I); Bm. ’2I—I,426 (sq. 27-64’; stratum II); Bm. ’2o—I,4o3 (sq. 18-26’; stratum II); Sk. ’30—22 (sq. 19-87’; stratum VI) and Sk. ’19—933 (sq. 59'114’; stratum II; Block D’; deposit E). 506 STONE OBJECTS [011. 25 Prof. Baker’s conclusion, as already indicated, was that the porcelain—agate was a nat'iiral substance produced, possibly in a volcanic region, by the long-continued heating of ordinary quartz.

Other stones that are also used, but at a later date, for the same kind of disks or roundels for inlay and incrusted work, are veined agate, rock-crystal and jade. Most of the specimens of these that we possess come from the jeweller’s store-jar found in Deposit E of Block D’ (Sk. ’19—933, stratum II) and belong to the Parthian period.I Some specimens of the agate pieces are illustrated in P1. 147, h, j—m, o, p. All are plano- convex, the round disks being from 1-37 to 1-62 in. in diameter, the amygdaloid piece 262 in. in length. Dating as they do from the ﬁrst century A.D., these specimens of agate are interesting in connexion with Pliny’s description of the myrrhiua vasa, since they illustrate precisely what he means when he says that some of them contain crystals and depressed spots that look like warts.2 Of the rock~crystai pieces, one is round (diam. 1-62 in.) and two oval (length 0-93 and 1-37 in. respectively). Since reekverystal was transparent and colourless, it is probable that silver or gold foil was put at the back 0f the crystal, just as silver foil was put at the back of carbuncles to enhance their brillianey’. Of jade, only two pieces have been found, both in the jeweller’s store-jar. One is a ﬂat lentieuiar piece with a hale in its middle (diam. 1-75 in), the other a broken disk (length 1.87 in). A much ﬁner kind of inlay is represented by a number of small hits 01"" turquoise cut into various shapes—hearts, commas, crescents, circles, etc. These turquoise pieces also come from the same jeweller’s hoard, and were no doubt designed for cloisonné jewellery.

The weights found at Taxila are more than usually valuable, as they are the ﬁrst of their kind to be found in suﬂicient number for us to ﬁx their values with Virtual accuracy, as well as the ratios which they bear to one another. These weights are invariably made of a hard stone—granite, hornblende—gneiss, pyroxene, diorite or chert—and are spherical in shape, that being, so far as we know, the usual shape then in vogue in Hindustan and other parts of India. In this respect they differ from the weights in use in prehistoric times, which are usually cubical in form,I 1 Cf. M.I.C. ch. XXIX, p. 589. CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 509 though, in the case of larger weights, sometimes conical. Why a spherical weight should have Been preferred to a cubical or cOnical one, is not apparent, since it is neither a convenient shape when the weights are being piled together in the scales, nor, on the other hand, would it have stood in the way of dishonesty, if anyone had wished to grind down their weights. Possibly there was some reason with which we are not now acquainted. Apart from their shape, there is another feature of these stone balls that requires particular notice, because it may have to be taken into account when calculating their original weight. Many of them have a small cylindrical hole drilled into their surface, which was probably made when the weights were being ofﬁcially checked, and left hollow, if the weight had to be reduced, or ﬁlled with lead, if it had to be increased. Some of the balls still retain this lead packing in their cavities; in others the cavities are hollow. We must not, however, take it for granted that the cavity was always hollow, since in the course of the ages, the lead may obviously have decayed or fallen out. Nor, on the other hand, must we take it for granted that any given cavity was necessarily intended to be ﬁlled or partly ﬁlled. It may have been made, merely to reduce the weight, when the balls were being ofﬁcially tested, this being the quickest means of achieving that end. In the same way modern iron weights often have circular cavities drilled ”out of their underside, which are either left hollow or ﬁlled with lead according as the weight has to be reduced or increased. Altogether, some ﬁfty-four spherical weights have been found at Taxila, but of these, two are evidently unﬁnished and eleven have their edges so rubbed or chipped that it is impossible to draw reliable conclusions from them. The remaining thirty- nine all come from Sirkap, twenty-ﬁve from the jeweller’s hoard in Block D’ (Sk. 933/56) ;I seven from another group (Sk. 729); and three from another (Sk. 225). In discussing them I shall deal ﬁrst with the series of twenty-ﬁve from the jeweller’s hoard, since these not only comprise the largest number, but belonging as they did to a jeweller, by whom they would no doubt be used for the weighing of precious metals, they are likely to have been more than usually accurate. . . - It needs but a glance at the serial ﬁgures of these weights given below to perceive that the majority of them fall into a regular binary sequence of ratios. Thus, starting from the last and smallest unit no. 25, which is 51-5 gr. tr., the ratios of the last eighteen are, with one exception, as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64. The exception is no. 13, which has a weight of 1,075 gr. tr. equivalent to twenty times the smallest unit. Now, eliminating the two weights 16 and 23, which are damaged, and taking the average of the remainder, we ﬁnd that the unit works out at 52-3 gr. tr. or, allowing for wear and tear, say 53 gr. tr. This is the weight of the standard Indian punch—marked coin known as kdrshdpazza, and also one of the commonest units in the prehistoric weights of the Indus valley. The series of weights, then, should be, 53, 106, 212, 424, 848 (1,060), 1,696, 3,392 gr. tr. It may be that the loss from wear and tear I See vol.

Comparing these calculated ﬁgures with the individual weights, we see that, out of the last eighteen items in the series, there are only two whose weight exceeds the ﬁgure calculated, viz. nos. 17 and 24, the former being 6 gr. in excess of 424 and the latter 3 gr. in excess of 106. This is a very slight error when we consider the great irregularities in the weights of coins belonging to one and the same issue, and the diﬂiculty of determining exact weights with the kind of scales or other instruments which were then available. Moreover, it is to be noticed that these two are among the weights which have no cavities in them, and it is quite possible, therefore, that they had not passed the ofﬁcial test. So far, then, the sequence of ratios is clear; but the remaining items of the list, viz. nos. 1—7, offer more difﬁculty. Taking no. 7 ﬁrst, it is to be noted that this weight is a particularly well-preserved one, without chip or cavity, and that there is no allowance, therefore, to be made except for ordinary wear and tear, which with a heavy ball such as this may be put down at, say, 20 or 30 gr. The ratio, then, which this weight evidently represents is the 104th in the series, having a calculated weight of 5,512 gr. tr., as compared with the actual weight of 5,480 gr. tr. or 5,510,",142-ee,Dh,,1914

No. 6, with a weight of 6,030 gr. tr. is also a well—preserved weight, without cavity or chip, and the ratio that it represents is the 1 14th with a calculated weight of 6,042 gr. tr. Nos. 5 and 3 are both chipped, the loss in the former being some 40 gr. and in the latter about 5 gr. Seemingly, therefore, these and no. 4 are to be grouped together, the ratio to which they belong being the 1 16th, with a calculated weight of 6,148 gr. tr. There remain nos.

For this and the chipping an addition of 50 to 60 gr. may be made. This weight, therefore, may be taken to belong to the 120th ratio group with a calculated weight of 6,360 gr. tr.

The latter follow a binary system, like those of TaXila, in the smaller weights and then decimal, the succession of weights being in the ratios 1, 2 (% X 8), 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 160, 200, 320, 640, 1,600. The commonest weight, of the ratio 16 in this series, has a mean calculated value of 211-5 gr. tr.,I which to all intents is identical with the corresponding weight at Taxila of something under 212 gr. Similarly, the fourth in the Indus series has an average weight of 52-875 gr., which is only one-eighth of a grain different from the mean calculated average of the corresponding weight at TaXila. It is quite evident, therefore, that these weights had come down from an immemorial antiquity in India—and it is natural to ﬁnd them employed for the silver kdrshdpana coinage which was current in the third century B.C. throughout the Maurya Empire. The commonest and most widely diffused of these kdrshdpanas averaged, under the Mauryas, between 51-5 and 52-5 gr., although good specimens exist as high as 54 and as low as 50 gr.2 It was only in the North-West of India, which had come under Persian inﬂuence during the rule of the Achaemenids, that a somewhat heavier kc’irsha‘pana was used, weighing some 56 gr. or more, the purpose of increasing it to this weight being to equate it with the Persian szgloz', two of which would go to three of these heavier kdrshdpanas. 1 Cf.

CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 479 The semi-precious stones enumerated above were used only for small articles of a more or less ‘brnamental character, and the commoner varieties of hard stones, such as gneiss, hornblende, granite, sang-i—abri, etc., for those articles of daily use ——celts, pivot-stones, querns, mullers, etc.—-which were subject to excessive wear and tear. On the other hand, household vessels which had to be turned on a lathe, lamps, ladles, toilet—trays, caskets, palettes and objects generally which were not exposed to rough usage, as well as sculptures in relief and in the round, were naturally cut from the softer varieties of stone. This general observation, however, is subject to certain qualiﬁcations. In the prehistoric age, it had been customary to make certain vessels, particularly shallow dishes, bowls and saucers, of gneiss, hornblende, granite and other refractory stones, the stone being ﬁrst chipped and then ground away with the help of a specially shaped stone—borer aided with sand as a fricatiVe. One of these borers, dating from Chalcolithic times, was found at Mohenjo-daro, and is described in my Mohenjo-daro and the Indus Civilisation, vol. II, p. 459. The same practice seems to have been continued at Taxila into historic times, but the lathe also came early into use, and there are some ﬁne specimens of Maurya vessels made of these hard stones, which have been turned on the lathe instead of being ground out with the borer. By the beginning of the Christian era, however, such vessels were almost invariably made of one or other of the soft schist stones, or of steatite or alabaster. Another exception to the general rule stated above is provided by some of the querns and mullers. In the Chalcolithic Age saddle-querns had invariably been made of hard stone—generally basalt or gneiss, and the saddle-quern and its mullet, like the mortar and pestle, continued to be made of some similar hard stone like quartzite, hornblende or abri; but when the stool—quern came into fashion, in the Maurya period, both it and the mullet used with it were made of sandstone. This may have been because it had been found by experience that sandstone was peculiarly suited to the grinding of grains and spices, and because it lent itself more readily to the ornamental carving which is found on many of these stool- querns. The ﬁrst part of this observation applies also to the circular grindstones (Class V, a) which were ﬁrst introduced at Taxila during the ﬁrst century of the Christian era, and for which sandstone is still usually preferred. On the other hand, the crushing mills of Class V, b, which had to be specially strong and durable, were invariably made of hard quartzite. The sandstone used for these objects in the Bhir Mound settlements, i.e. up to the beginning of the second century B.C., is of four kinds: (1) the grey Taraki or Kambial sandstone, which is found in plenty some 14 or 15 miles south-east of Taxila, and which was used for the pillars and pilasters of the Jandial temple.I (2) A spotted red and white sandstone which comes from Mathura near Agra. (3) A buff-coloured, ﬁne-grained hard sandstone, usually with small black spots, from Chunar near Benares. (4) A greyish quartz sandstone of very hard texture, the provenance of which has not yet been ascertained. The second of these is well ‘ A strong axis of this rock runs along the Chirpar hills. 61-2   Uses to which hard and soft stones were put Varieties of sandstone used in Bhir Mound Settlements   i a? i ii :5 Other soft stones used in Bhir Mound settlements Wider use of soft stones under Greeks and their successors “ alabaster, capable of resisting considerable heat. Alabaster and steatite, on the   480 STONE OBJECTS [011.25 known, not only from the many statues or reliefs of the early Mathura School which are carved from it, but also from innumerable monuments of Moslem times which were built of it at Agra, Delhi and Mathura. The third variety is also well known from the historic pillars of this stone which were set up by the Emperor As’oka in the third century 3.0. That this particular sandstone should be found in the form of mullers at so remote a spot as Taxila is at ﬁrst sight surprising, since it could hardly have been brought such a distance for the sole purpose of making utensils which could have been equally well made of Taraki sandstone or of one of the harder local stones. The explanation appears to be that As’oka had set up one or more of his famous pillars, and possibly some other monuments as well, at Taxila ;that these monuments had been thrown down and broken after the eclipse of the Maurya power; and that the mullers were made out of some of the fragments, just as a piece of one of these selfsame pillars was used last century for a road—roller and a piece of another for a sugar-cane press! However this may be, these mullers of Chunar stone are found only in the later deposits of the Maurya period in the Bhir Mound, not in Sirkap or on any of the later sites. On the other hand, the Taraki, Mathura, and quartzite sandstone all occur on the Sirkap site, in strata of the ﬁrst century A.D., and besides them there occurs also on that site a variety of deeply coloured red and purple sandstone belonging to the Murree group, which is found in large deposits round about Sang—jani, some 10 miles south-east of Taxila. ‘ The other soft stones found on the Bhir Mound are steatite, alabaster and slate. All three of these have a wide distribution in India and are easily obtainable at Taxila—slate especially so, since it is found in large quantities in the Hazara district within a few miles of the city, and, as we have already seen, it was freely used for the construction of drains and bathroom ﬂoors, while alabaster is equally proliﬁc in the gypsum deposits at the foot of the Salt Range in the Panjab. Thanks to their ﬁne texture, both slate and alabaster could be carved with the minutest ﬁgures in relief, and we ﬁnd both of them employed for the exquisitely carved ring— stones of Maurya date described below (nos. 129—31). Slate, too, was employed for small jewellery and inlay moulds, since, apart from its ﬁne texture, it was, unlike           other hand, were occasionally used during the Maurya period for small household vessels. That stone was not more freely employed during that period for household vessels and utensils was in all probability due to the religious conservatism of the people, who then as now were afraid of contaminating their food or drink if they took them from any vessels other than the orthodox ones made either of earthen- ware or of copper or brass. It was certainly not due to any lack of skill on the part of the Maurya craftsman, who was unsurpassed in the cutting, carving and polishing of hard stones. With the advent of the Bactrian Greeks at Taxila the carving of stone in relief and the turning of it on the lathe into vessels became increasingly common, and in the later cities on the Sirkap site we ﬁnd not only far more objects made out of soft CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 481 stone but several more varieties of stone introduced. For vessels and other small household objects, the stones that now come into use (besides several kinds of slate, steatite and sandstone) are: schist, micaceous schist, hornblende schist, phyllite, phyllitic slate and indurated clay or mudstone; while the stones in use for sculpture are schist, micaceous schist, chloritic schist, quartz mica schist, phyllite, steatite or soapstone of various kinds, Taraki grey sandstone and red ferruginous claystone. Of these, the commonest by far and the most important are the several kinds of schist and the dark grey phyllite which is used for the vast majority of Gandhara sculptures. The use of both schist and phyllite was intimately bound up with the history of sculpture at Taxila. The earliest specimens of schist are the grey schist dishes nos. 38 and 39 and the carved toilet-tray no. 62, which are referable to the latter part of the second century or the beginning of the ﬁrst century B.C. From that time onwards schist comes more and more into vogue, and during the Parthian domination is used commonly for caskets, household vessels, lamps and sculptures. For the last mentioned, a chloritised micaceous schist was at ﬁrst favoured in preference to other stones, phyllite then being exceedingly rare, even for household vessels, but in the ﬁrst century A.D. phyllite began to supersede schist, no doubt owing to its being more durable in other respects and less liable to split in the process of carving; and from that time onwards nine—tenths or more of the carvings found on the North—West Frontier and at Taxila are made of this stone. The precise provenance of the several kinds of schist and phyllite stones is not known, but there can be no doubt that all of them came from quarries in the Gandhara region, pr‘Obably in the neighbourhood of Southern Swat, since it was there that the Gandhara School of sculpture had its chief centre, and we may be sure that, wherever that centre was, the stone quarries could not have been far distant. Moreover, had the quarries been in the old North-West Frontier itself—— that is, within the conﬁnes of what until recently was British India, it is virtually certain that they would long ago have been discovered. Some day, no doubt, they will be located, and it may be that fresh light will then be thrown on the history of this important school of sculpture. In the meantime it would be a helpful step, particularly for elucidating the early chronology of this school, if someone equipped with suﬂicient knowledge of the subject would examine the various collections of these sculptures in India and Europe and classify them according to the varieties of stone used.

Objects found in trial trenches or in spoil earth are not included in the above Table. The number of prehistoric artefacts is very small. Up to the present no pre- historic settlement has been discovered at Taxila, nor is there any reason to suppose that any ever existed there. The few celts and one mace-head described below were found in strata of the historic period on the Sirkap site, dating back no further than the ﬁrst centuries 3.0. and A.D. How they came to be present in these late strata can only be surmised, but a possible explanation is that stone weapons may have continued to be used for sacriﬁcial or other ceremonial purposes many centuries",,Gr,,
