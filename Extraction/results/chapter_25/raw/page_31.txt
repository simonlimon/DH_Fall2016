Prof. Baker’s conclusion, as already indicated, was that the porcelain—agate was
a nat'iiral substance produced, possibly in a volcanic region, by the long-continued
heating of ordinary quartz. Whence it came, however, is not known. Cf. A.S.R.

139. Other stones that are also used, but at a later date, for the same kind of disks or
roundels for inlay and incrusted work, are veined agate, rock-crystal and jade. Most of the
specimens of these that we possess come from the jeweller’s store-jar found in Deposit E
of Block D’ (Sk. ’19—933, stratum II) and belong to the Parthian period.I

Some specimens of the agate pieces are illustrated in P1. 147, h, j—m, o, p. All are plano-
convex, the round disks being from 1-37 to 1-62 in. in diameter, the amygdaloid piece 262 in.
in length. Dating as they do from the ﬁrst century A.D., these specimens of agate are interesting
in connexion with Pliny’s description of the myrrhiua vasa, since they illustrate precisely what
he means when he says that some of them contain crystals and depressed spots that look like
warts.2 Of the rock~crystai pieces, one is round (diam. 1-62 in.) and two oval (length 0-93 and
1-37 in. respectively). Since reekverystal was transparent and colourless, it is probable that
silver or gold foil was put at the back 0f the crystal, just as silver foil was put at the back of
carbuncles to enhance their brillianey’. Of jade, only two pieces have been found, both in the
jeweller’s store-jar. One is a ﬂat lentieuiar piece with a hale in its middle (diam. 1-75 in),
the other a broken disk (length 1.87 in).

A much ﬁner kind of inlay is represented by a number of small hits 01" turquoise cut into
various shapes—hearts, commas, crescents, circles, etc. These turquoise pieces also come
from the same jeweller’s hoard, and were no doubt designed for cloisonné jewellery. Cf. for
examples, ‘Jewellery’, ch. 30, nos. 56—8, 137—40, 167—8.

CLASS XXV. Eyes and ﬁrnas of images (nos. 14o, u—c)

No. 140, a is the eye of an image (diam. 1 in.) made of lapis-lazuli inlaid with a circle of shell.
It is of the Parthian period and from the same jeweller’s hoard as the preceding. Cf. A.S.R.
(1919), P1. VIII, 8. (Pls. 142,p; 203, 2'.)

Nos. 140, b and c are spherical umds of rock-crystal, of which many other examples have
been found; the former has a diameter of I in., the latter of 0-68 in. Both come from the
Dharmarajika Stﬁpa, and are probably of the fourth or ﬁfth century AD. For stone eyes of
Greek and Roman images, cf. Dar. et Sag. IV, 14.92, ﬁg. 6614. Cf. p. 188, no. 16 supra.

(Pl. 147, e, 2'.)

CLASS XXVI. Moulds (nos. 141—52). Cf. ‘Terra-cottas’, ch. 24, Class XXII;
‘Copper and Bronze’, ch. 28, Claser

Small moulds for the casting of metal ornaments were in use at Taxila from an
early age—«at least from the ﬁfth century 3.0., but only one example of them
(no. 141) has been found in the Bhir Mound.

This is a mould for two pendent beads, cut out of a ﬁne bloched grey slate.
The rest come from the Sirkap site, and are made of various stones—claystone,
limestone, slate, steatite, grey schist and micaceous-schist, the two earliest, Which
are referable to the Bactrian-Greek period, being of claystone and steatite.

Ten of these Sirkap moulds are for pendants, ﬁnger-rings and other small
personal ornaments, while two are for the small metal pieces—dots, commas,
crescents, lozenges, etc., required in inlay work. The former are found in all the
