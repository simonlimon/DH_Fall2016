CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 485

after the Neolithic and Chalcolithic Ages had passed, just as stone knives con—
tinued to be used until a late date for religious sacriﬁces by the Egyptians and Jews.
On the other hand, it is noteworthy that the few artefacts found at Taxila are for
the most part made of rare and striking stones, Viz. green epidiorite, epidote-quartz,
nephrite-jade and blue serpentine, and it may well be that such striking objects
were kept in later times merely as curiosities or talismans.

with slightly crescentic edge and ﬂattened butt. Length 3-75 in. Sp. gr. of epidiorite= 3-14.
Pl. I o, a.
( 2. ‘Sk. ’2)8-—2II; Block A’; sq. I 586'; stratum IV. Short, splayed celt of dark green epidote-
quartz, with crescentic cutting edge; polished. Length 268 in. Sp. gr. of stone=2-98.
(Pls. 140, b; 143, a.)

3. Sk. ’29—I,I63; Block A’; sq. 19-94’; stratum III. Short celt of polished nephritic jade, with
crescentic cutting edge. Length 3-25 in. Sp. gr. of stone=2-96. Cf. p. 195 supra. (Pl. 140, c.)

4. Sk. ’17—585; Block G; sq. loo-58’; stratum III. Long celt of the Bandelkhand type, of
grey quartzite, with blunted crescentic edge. Cf. p. 168 supra. Length 512 in. (Pl. 140, g.)

5. Sk. ’16 ;‘ Trench A728; stratum II. Pear—shaped mace-head of blue serpentine, of a type
found at Mohenjo—daro and Harappa as well as in Western Asia. Cf. M.I.C. I, p. 36, and

II, p. 459. (Pl. 140, d.)
CLASS II. Pivot-stones (nos. 6—10)

Pivot-stones were used for two purposes, either for potter’s Wheels, with a small
depression in the centre for the tenon of the wheel to turn in, or for house—doors,
with a much larger cavity to take the projecting tenon at the bottom or top of the
door. In both types a hard stone such as gneiss, quartzite, hornblende or granite
was used, enmetimes in the form of a natural pebble.

Type a. Wﬁeeémekéts.

6. But. ’12ng 53 ; erratum I. Circular slab of grey gneiss stone, with a small cavity sunk in
the middle at 0:16: face. Diam. 7-12 in. '

7. Sk. ’19-«869; Block 13’; sq. 73-99’; stratum II. Natural pebble of white quartzite with
a small cavity in one face. Length 52 5 in. Cf. p. 184. supra.

Type 5. Door-sockets.

8. Bm. ’19—I,801; sq. 5~59’; stratum IV. Circular pivot-stone of gneiss, with hole in
middle pierced through the thickness of the stone. Diam. 5- 5 in.

9. Bm. ’20—1, 582; sq. 14-30’; stratum I. Similar, of red granite, but with shallow depression
on one side only. Diam. 5.75 in. (Pl. 143, b.)

IO. Sk. ’16; Trench A725; stratum II. Similar to no. 8, but of hornblende-gneiss. Diam.
5-12 in.

CLASS III. Querns (nos. 11—18)

The oldest form of quern in India is the slab or saddle-quern, specimens of
which have been found among the Chalcolithic ruins of Harappa and Mohenjo—daro
(cf. M.I.C. pp. 25, 456—7). Querns of a similar type, dating from the ﬁrst
century A.D., occur on the Sirkap site at T axila, and are still widely used in India
as 31'] or kari stones, though rarely for the grinding of grain. Strange to say, no
