to be taken into the above calculations, are given below. Like the others, they are
made of granite, hornblende-gneiss, pyroxene and diorite.

The above weights show a remarkably close correspondence not only with those
of the punch-marked coins (kdrshdpazza) of the early historic period, but also with
the prehistoric weights of the third and fourth millennia B.C. found at Mohenjo-
dam and Harappﬁ. The latter follow a binary system, like those of Taxila, in the
smaller weights and then decimal, the succession of weights being in the ratios I,
2 (% x 8), 4, 8, I6, 32, 64, I60, 200, 320, 640, 1,600. The commonest weight, of the
ratio 16 in this series, has a mean calculated value of 211-5 gr. tr.,I which to all
intents is identical with the corresponding weight at Taxila of something under
212 gr. Similarly, the fourth in the Indus series has an average weight of 52-87 5 gr.,
which is only one-eighth of a grain different from the mean calculated average of
the corresponding weight at TaXila. It is quite evident, therefore, that these weights
had come down from an immemorial antiquity in India—and it is natural to ﬁnd
them employed for the silver kdrshdpana coinage which was current in the third
century B.C. throughout the Maurya Empire. The commonest and most widely
diffused of these ka'rshdpazzas averaged, under the Mauryas, between 51-5 and
52-5 gr., although good specimens exist as high as 54 and as low as 50 gr.2 It was
only in the North-West of India, which had come under Persian inﬂuence during
the rule of the Achaemenids, that a somewhat heavier ka’rshdpazza was used,
weighing some 56 gr. or more, the purpose of increasing it to this weight being to

equate it with the Persian szgloz’, two of which would go to three of these heavier
kdrshdpazzas.
