Harappa (no. 649) exhibiting the goddess with her legs wide apart, as on the
plaqiies referred to, but portrayed upside down with a plant issuing from her
womb instead of from her neck. The cult of the 310111, as of the liﬁga, has long been
recognised as pre—Aryan in origin, and examples of it might naturally be expected
to occur among the antiquities of Harappa and Mohenjo—daro, which there are the
strongest reasons for regarding as pre-Aryan. Whether the pre—Aryan ‘ goddess of
Fertility ’ afterwards came to be identiﬁed with the Vedic Prithivi and whether it is
the latter or the former who is represented on the Taxila ring—stOnes are questions
on which further light is needed.

129. Bm. ’21—828; sq. 45-71’; stratum II. Circular ring—stone of purplish brown alabaster,
carved on upper face with three concentric bands of cable-moulding, divided one from the
other by band of ‘cross—and—reel’ pattern. Diam. 2-62 in. Round the central hole are three
standing ﬁgures of a nude goddess, alternating with a foliate design, which we may presume to
represent the Indian ‘Tree of Life and Fortune’ (kalpa-vriksha or kalpa—druma), so familiar
on the carved balustrades and gateways of the Buddhists at Bharhut and Sanchi. For
jewel-like workmanship and exquisite ﬁnish this and the following ring~stones are as ﬁne as
any specimens of stonewarvmg in ancient India. Cf. ASJR. (1920), Pi. XVII, 30 and M.I.C.
vol. I, p. 62. (Pl. 147, la.)

13o. Bm. ’21M829; sq. 4671'; stratum II. Fragment of ring~stone similar to preceding, but
of quartzite sandstene. Qriginal diam. 4 in. In this example, the inner cross-and—reel band is
replaced by a line of elephants, and to the side cf, the central hole is a conventional mountain
with a hand on one side and a hand holding a bow on the other. (Pl. 147, c.)

131. Bm. ’24~609; sq. x3'57’; stratum III. Similar to no. 129, but a fragment only, of
ferruginous claystone. Length 225 in. (P1. 147, d.)

132. Sk. ’27—I,241; Main Street; sq. 229'73’; stratum II. Similar to no. 129, but of slate-
stone. Diam. 3-25 in. Round the central hole are four instead of three ﬁgures of the ‘Nude
goddess’, alternating with the ‘ Tree of Life and Fortune ’. This specimen, found in stratum II
of Sirkap appears to be a survival from the Maurya period. Cf. M.I.C. vol. III, Pl. CLIX,

nos. 9, IO. (Pl. 147, g.)
B. Aya‘gapaza tablet.

13 3. Only two dydgapaia tablets have been found at T axila—one of burnt clay (see ‘ Terra—
cottas’, ch. 24, no. 56) and the other of stone. The latter (no. 13 3) is an insigniﬁcant specimen
of indurated claystone, 4- 5 x 3-5 in., with a circular depression in the middle of the upper face
and representations of shells (s’aﬁkha), shield-symbols, swastika, lotuses and ﬁsh (matsya)
round the edges. It was found at Tofkiaﬁ in Sirsukh (83. ’15—65), 2 ft. 6 in. below surface,
and dates probably from the fourth or ﬁfth century A.D. Cf. A.S.R. (1915), p. 22, no. 19 and
P1. XVI, g. (Pl. 146, no. 133.)

C. Amulets.I

134. Bm. ’19—2,o78; spoil earth. This little amulet (broken) in the form of a trimma comes
from spoil earth on the Bhir Mound and is referable to the Maurya period. It is I in. in length,
made of ferruginous claystone and engraved with a spiraliform pattern all over its front surface,
the back being plain and ﬂat. Like most Mauryan work, the carving is strikingly neat and
precise. (Pl. 142, m.)

135. Sk. ’29—3,197, is a claw or tooth amulet of white marble, 2-37 in. long, with a pair of

I For a crystal lion, symbolic of the Buddha, which no doubt possessed amuletic properties, see
vol. I, p. 245 and P1. 49, b. It was found in stﬁpa N7 at the Dharmarajika.
