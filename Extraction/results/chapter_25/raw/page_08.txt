CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 491

deﬁned, and are almost always carinated like the specimens described below, with which we
may compare also the earthenware saucer no. 107 (p. 418). (P1. 143, j.)

44. Sk. ’28—2,211; Block F’; sq. 84-89’; stratum IV. Saucer of grey schist, ﬁnely turned on
lathe; carinated sides and everted lip. Incised concentric circles in bottom, inside. Diam. 2' 37 in.

45. Sk. ’13—1,332; Block E; sq. 69-61’; stratum II. Saucer of micaceous schist, with
carinated sides and everted rim. Border of lattice triangles on rim and foliate pattern below,
inside. Diam. 4-25 in. Cf. p. 162, no. 8 supra. (P13. 140, r; 143, k.)

46. Sk. ’20—764; Block D’; sq. 57-92’; stratum I. Similar, of grey schist, with incised net-
work on everted rim, and quatrefoil rosette on bottom, inside, surrounded by foliate circle.
Diam. 3-62 in. Cf. p. 190 supra. (P13. 140, u; 143, i.)

47. Sk. ’14—481; Block C’; sq. 41-78’; stratum II. Similar, but with ﬂat base and rounded
sides. Quatrefoil rosette on bottom, surrounded by concentric circles. Diam. 2-62 in.
Cf. p. 193 supra. (Pl. 140, x.)

CLASS IX. Standard cups (nos. 48, 49). Cf. ‘Pottery’, ch. 23, Class XX, a

The difference between the earlier and later saucers noticed above extends also
to the standard cups or low tazzas described below. No. 49, which comes from the
Saka-Parthian city in Sirkap, has a much more stylish and sharply deﬁned form
than no. 48, which comes from the Maurya level in the Bhir Mound.

48. Bm. ’20—1, 568; sq. 17-33’; stratum II. Standard cup of hard abrz' stone, turned on lathe.
Diam. 3-87 in. (Pl. 140, y.)

49. Sk. ’14—966; Block C’; sq. 45-80’; stratum II. Similar, but of grey schist, with incurved
sides and wide angular rim. Diam. 36 in. Cf. p. 193 supra. (P1. 140, 2.)

C LASS X. Bowls (nos. 50, 51). Cf.‘ Pottery’, ch. 23, Class XV; ‘ Iron ’, ch. 27, Class III;
‘ Copper and Bronze ’, ch. 28, Class XVI; ‘ Silverware ’, ch. 29, Class IV

The only example of a stone bowl from the Bhir Mound is the small bowl of
highly polished agate no. 50, and the only example from Sirkap is the steatite one
from the Mahal site, no. 51. The former is of the third century 3.0., the latter of
the second half of the ﬁrst century A.D.

50. Bm. ’21—983; sq. 16-63’; stratum II. Piece of banded-agate bowl, highly polished inside
and out. Length 162 in. i

51. Sk. (ML), ’25—252; sq. 42-115’; 2 ft. 10 in. below surface. Small bowl of purple-grey
steatite; diam. 3-25 in. Outside is ornamented with horizontal bands of incised linear designs
—network, swags and lotus leaves—and a simple beading in relief. (Pl. 141, a.)

CLASS XI. Open-mouthed vases with ﬂat bases (nos. 52—6).
Cf. ‘Pottery’, ch. 23, Class VII

These correspond with Class VII of the pottery vessels, except that there is no
example in stone of this type of vessel with a standard base. They are found only
in the Saka—Parthian city in Sirkap.

52. Sk. ’27—I,342; Sixth Street (west); sq. 66'119’; stratum II. Small open-mouthed vase
of grey hornblende-schist, with ﬂat base, beading at base of neck, and three incised bands
round body. The neck is pierced with four holes for suspension or for attaching a cover.
Height 5- 5 in. Cf. p. 184 supra. (Pl. 141, b.)
