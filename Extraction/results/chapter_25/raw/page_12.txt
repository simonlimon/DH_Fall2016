CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 487

squares; on each side is a lotus ‘Tree of Life’ (kulpu—luzd) springing from a vase with ﬁshes in
each bend of its“’sinuous stalk. The bracket supporting the projecting end was in the form of
a yuksht' or urikshadeei, of which only the head remains. The quern, which is 13-5 in. long, is
broken in three pieces, and two of the legs, with the front brackets, are missing. Cf. p. 190
supra. (Pl. 140, h.)

18. Sk. ’21—-15; Block 1'; sq. 1 3177’; stratum 11. Similar, of reddish sandstone with pro-
jecting end, decorated with simple swag-like border, swastika and trirutuu devices. Length
14-5 in. Cf. p. 196 supra. (Pl. 140,22)

CLASS IV. Mullers (nos. 19—26)

The mullers used with these querns are generally between 9 and I I in. in length
(but some are shorter) and 2 to 3 in. in diameter. Some are made of basalt, quart-
zite, hornblende or other hard stone; others of sandstone. The former are used
along with the hard-stone querns, the latter with the sandstone ones. The most
orthodox shape seems to have been a long slightly barrel—shaped cylinder. Some,
however, were-true cylinders, and others Were natural pebbles rubbed roughly into
shape. Many of the cylindrical specimens have been worn down by use in the
middle or ﬂattened on one side. The following few examples from among the many
found on the Bhir Mound and in Sirkap will sufﬁce.

zite. A singularly ﬁne specimen of dark grey-green colour and perfectly cylindrical in shape,
with ﬂat ends. Length 8-37 in. Sp. gr. of stone=2-66. Cf. p. 171 supra.

C L A s s V. Grinding-mills (nos. 27—43 1)

Type a. As indicated above, circular grinding-mills came into use at Taxila for
the ﬁrst time during the late Saka—Parthian period. The earliest specimen is no. 27.

27. Sk.’ 12; Trench A 461 , stratum II. From Sirkap; made of grey Taraki sandstone.
Diam. 16-5 in. In this and the following specimens, the centre hole, through which the
grain was introduced, was pierced through the nether as well as the upper millstone, the nether
hole being then plugged with wood and furnished with a pivot or spike. In no. 27, the upper
stone is convex above, concave underneath, thinning rapidly towards the edge, while the nether
is convex above in order‘to ﬁt with the upper one. As this grinding-mill was meant to be worked
by two persons, the upper stone was provided with socket-holes for two handles. (P1. 140, k.)
