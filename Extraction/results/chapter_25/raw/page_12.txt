CH. 25] STONE OBJECTS 495

The ﬁgures are clad in the Greek chitou and himation. In the lower register, seven lines sug-
gestive of a palniette. On rim, beaded border in low relief. This toilet—tray is referable to the
ﬁrst century B.C., when Hellenistic art was becoming barbarised under the rule of the Sakas.
Observe that the ﬁgures in this scene are more widely spaced than in the later Parthian reliefs,
in this respect being nearer to the Hellenistic tradition, in spite of their stiff and rigid
formality. The wig—like treatment of the hair and the wide—open, prominent eyes are peculiarly
characteristic of nascent Gandhara sculpture during the late Saka period. These traits are well
exempliﬁed also in nos. 70, 74 and 75, and in ‘Stone Sculptures’, ch. 36, nos. 3, 4, 12, 13, etc.

cited by S. Levy, Quid de Graecz's, p. 22. (Pl. 144, no. 63.)

64. Sk. ’28—1,486; Block F’; sq. 85-90’; stratum II. Half of a broken toilet-tray of yellowish
brown steatite (soapstone), divided into two registers. Diam. 4-12 in. In the upper register,
man reclining on bed and kissing woman, who is seated on stool by his side. On rim, four
concentric circles. Two small holes drilled near centre and in rim appear to have served for
rivets, when the tray was mended in old days. On the back is an inscription in Kharoshthi:
(along the edge) Thireasa tritavi(na) mudrao Ums'e Arya—Ro. . .; (in the middle) Thiraka.
Cf. p. 182 supra; A.S.R. (1928), P1. XX, II and p. 57, no. 56. (Pl. 144, no. 64.)

65. Sk. ’28—1,776; Block F’; sq. 85-89’; stratl‘Im II. Toilet-tray of greenish grey steatite
(soapstone). Diam. 662 in. On rim, border of double arcading, incised. In centre, drinking
scene.I Although the scene is a composite Whole, ﬁlling virtually the entire ﬁeld, it is divided
by convention into three tiers separated one from the other by projecting ﬂoors, so that the
ﬁgures in the upper and middle parts of the ﬁeld may have something on which to rest their
feet. In the top register, in centre, a man and woman are seated on a bench, the former
clasping his companion with his left arm and holding a sceptre with his right, while she offers
him a cup of wine. To left of them, a woman seated and draped, playing on a lyre; and, behind
her, a youth playing on the Pan-pipes; to right, a standing male ﬁgure with his right hand
wrapped in his mantle and his left holding a staff. In the middle register, to right, a large
wine-vat, rising from acanthus leaves, in Which two men, one on the back of the other, are
treading the grapes, while a lad, in the centre, draws off the juice in a tall ﬂagon (\‘J-rro7xﬁv10v).
To the left, another man is carrying a wine-skin on his back and emptying its contents into a
kmter, while his companion on the left of the vase is raising a bowl to his lips. Below, in the
bottom register, two ﬁgures are lying drunk. Framing the top of the scene from side to side is
an undulating vine. The back of the plaque is relieved with concentric bands, both incised and
in relief. Cf. A.S.R. (1928), P1. XIX, I and p. 56, no. 55. The style is typical of Hellenistic
art of the ﬁrst century A.D., and the relief is reminiscent of the ‘Wedding of Ariadne and
Bacchus ’—-a familiar scene in Graeco-Roman art. 'Cf. Dar. et Sag. II, p. 421; p. 182 supra.

66. Sk. ’12~814; Block G; sq. 108°63’; stratum I. Circular toilet-tray of indurated light grey
claystone, divided by partition into two registers. Diam. 5-2 5 in. In the upper register is a man
dancing with two women, one on either side. The lower compartment is empty. On the rim,
two concentric circles incised; on partition, short parallel lines. Of Parthian period; ﬁrst
century AD. Cf. p. 168 supra; A.S.R. (1912), P1. XXIX, b and p. 32, no. 1. (P1. 144, no. 66.)

67. Sk. ’28—63 5; Block B’; sq. 34°92’; stratum III. Toilet-tray of greyschist (diam. 362 in.),
divided into three compartments, with lotus rosette in background of all three. In upper
compartment, upper halves of two draped ﬁgures holding wine—cups. On rim, toothed border;
on partitions, diagonal lines incised. The workmanship is very rough, as if done by a wood-

carver. Cf. p. 194 supra. (P1. 144, no. 67.)
68. Sk. ’28—2,1 59; Block F’; sq. 90°84’; stratum II. Toilet-tray of micaceous schist, divided
