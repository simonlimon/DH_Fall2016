Type b:

120. Sk. ’29~I,173; Block 1’; sq. 11-100’; stratum III. Point of banded agate set in copper
handle and used as metal burnisher for very ﬁne work. Length 1 in. Cf. p. 196 supra.
(Pl. 142, 0.)

CLASS XIX. Toachstones (no. 121)

For the testing of gold, natural pebbles of black basanite or Lydian stone, highly
polished, were sometimes used (e.g. Bin. ’24~3 57; stratum III; and Sk. ’12—257;
stratum II) but most of the touchstones found at Taxila are made of hard siliceous
slate cut into long strips, which still retain upon them the marks of the gold.
Touchstones of this type, however, have been found only in the later strata in
Sirkap.

121. Sk. ’14—1,953; Block E’; sq. 73'75’; stratum III. Touchstone of hard siliceous slate,
with gold streaks still visible on its surface. Size 8-25 x I~12><o-75 in. Cf. p. 184 supra;
A.S.R. (1914), p. 20. (P1. 146, no. 121.)

Other specimens of the same shape and material are: Sk. ’26~4,148; Sk. ’19—933/46;
Sk. ’12—667. They vary in length from 5-55 to 10137 in.

CLASS XX. Palettes (nos. 122, 123)

Only two specimens of palettes have been found, one made of slate, from the
top stratum in Sirkap, the other of claystone from Mound C at landial.
122. Sk. ’19~257; Block E’; sq. 79-98’; stratum I. A circular palette of slate. Diam. 5-5 in.

one side for a single pigment.

C LAss XXI. Spindle—whorls (no. 124)

124. Spindle-whorls of stone are also rare and are found only in Sirkap. They are generally
made of micaceous schist or soapstone (e. g. Sk. ’12—81 and ’24—1 , 196) and are of the same shapes
as the terra-cotta ones; but there is one noteworthy specimen of rock-crystal, no. 124 (Sk. ’28—
1,681), which takes the form of a rather ﬂat barrel—disk bead, with a diam. of 162 in. It comes
from the Saka-Parthian city in Sirkap; Block F’; sq. 84-89'; stratum II. Cf. p. 182 supra.
(Pl. 142, k.)

CLAss XXII. Potter’s konoras and thatwas (nos. 12 5~8)

The konora and thatwa were used by the potter to thin out the clay walls of his
vessels. The konora is pressed with the left hand against the wall inside the vessel,
while with the thatwd in his right hand the potter gently taps the wall on the outside.
Both implements are still in use throughout India, the konora being frequently
made of earthenware and the thatwa‘ of wood. ‘
