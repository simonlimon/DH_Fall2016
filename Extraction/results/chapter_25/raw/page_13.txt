496 STONE OBJECTS [CH. 25

into nine sunk compartments. Diam. 5-12 in. In centre are buSts of male and female ﬁgures
with wine-cups in their hands. Both wear necklaces. In each of the four corner compartments
is a quatrefoil rosette. On the rim is a border of incised network, and on the back an incised
lotus design. Cf. p. 182 supra; A.S.R. (1928), Pl. XX, 6 and p. 57, no. 60. (P1. 144, no. 68.)

69. Sk. ’19—69 5; Block B’; sq. 28-116’; stratum II. Toilet-tray of grey schist, divided into
three compartments. Diam. 4-12 in. In the top compartment are the busts of a male and
a female holding wine-cups in their hands. Behind them, half lotus rosette. On the rim is a
network pattern incised; and on the partitions, toothed and cable beadings. On back, incised
eight-petalled lotus. Cf. p. 194 supra. (Pl. 144, no. 69.)

7o. Sk. ’2o——763; Block D'; sq. 57-92'; stratum I. Toilet-tray of grey schist divided into
three compartments. Diam. 6-86 in. In the upper half are ﬁgured, in relief, a male and a female,
three-quarter length, holding wine—cups in their hands. Both wear necklaces and the woman
has a shawl (sari) about her head and shoulders. On the rim is a double—cable border; on the
partitions, a dotted cross pattern. The Indianised character of the ﬁgures and the concise quality
of the carving point to the inﬂuence of the Mathura School. Cf. p. 190 supra. (P1. 144,
no. 70.) .

71. Sk. ’29—2,285; Block G'; sq. 105-89’; stratum II. Fragment of a grey schist toilet-tray
or perhaps the lid of a vessel, divided by radii into eight compartments, with lotus rosette in

73. Sk. ’27—501; Block E’; sq. 77-90’; stratum II. Toilet-tray of slate, divided into two
compartments. Diam. 6 in. In upper compartment, to left, winged stag ridden by winged
rider. To right, goat in foreground; winged lion behind. On rim, double arcading. On partition,

certain measure of Indian inﬂuence. Cf. p. 184 supra. (P1. 145, no. 73.)

74. Sk. ’15—277; Block A; sq. 24- 59’; stratum II. Circular toilet-tray of grey schist, without
compartments. Diam. 4-62 in. In upper ﬁeld, ﬁsh-tailed hippocamp with rider seated astride;
below, palmette rays. Dog—tooth border on rim. Cf. p. 145 supra. (Pl. 144, no. 74.)

75. Sk. ’27—607; Block E’; sq. 75-91’; stratum III. Similar, of grey micaceous schist, with
a ﬁsh—tailed grifﬁn and rider instead of hippocamp. Diam. 4- 56 in. Broken on right side.
Cf. p. 184 supra. (Pl. 145, no. 75.)

76. Sk. ’28—763; Block E’; sq. 74-98’; stratum II. Similar, of micaceous steatite with sea-
monster resembling Indian makara, ridden by a half-draped female ﬁgure holding a baby in

both sides of rim. On back, inscription of ﬁve Kharoshthi letters: Maritjuminasa, i.e. of Math-
jumina—probably the name of the person to whom the object belonged. Parthian period. Cf.
A.S.R. (1928), P1. XX, 10 and p. 55, no. 42. The style of the carving resembles that of no. 65, but
the workmanship is coarser. For the motif of a nereid riding on a hippocamp or sea-monster,
see Roscher, Lexikou, $.72. ‘ Nereid ’ ; also Dalton, Treasure of the Oxus, no. 197, P1. XXVI (2nd ed.).
Draped nereids were common in Greece in the ﬁfth to fourth centuries B.C. Later, they were
more often half-draped. Cf. p. 184 supra. (Pl. 145, no. 76.)

77. Sk. ’29—306; Block C’; sq. 44-92’; stratum II. Similar, of grey schist, divided into two
compartments. Diam. 5-43 in. In upper compartment, draped woman riding sideways on
ﬁsh—tailed sea-monster. On neck of monster, uncertain object, which may be a garland. On
rim, incised cable border. Cf. p. 193 supra. (P1. 145, no. 77.)
