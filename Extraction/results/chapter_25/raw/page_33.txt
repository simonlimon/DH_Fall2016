beauty of the polished agate is very striking and well explains why the Romans set such store
on the myrrhina 71am made of this stone. (Pl. 147, s.)

I 54. An oblong die of slate with the numbers I to 4 shown by small circlets on the four sides,
no. 1 being opposite to no. 4 instead of no. 3, as is usual in the dice of this period. Length
275 in. Sk. ”20—416; Block B’; sq. 31-86’; stratum II. Cf. ‘Bone and Ivory’, ch. 32, nos. 92—8,

length. It is made of dark grey hornblende—schist, and provided at the smaller end with a

CLASS XXVIII. Weights (Pl. 203, j)

The weights found at Taxila are more than usually valuable, as they are the ﬁrst
of their kind to be found in suﬂicient number for us to ﬁx their values with Virtual
accuracy, as well as the ratios which they bear to one another. These weights are
invariably made of a hard stone—granite, hornblende—gneiss, pyroxene, diorite or
chert—and are spherical in shape, that being, so far as we know, the usual shape
then in vogue in Hindustan and other parts of India. In this respect they differ
from the weights in use in prehistoric times, which are usually cubical in form,I
