490 STONE OBJECTS [CH. 25

CLASS VI. Pestles and mortars (nos. 32—5)

Pestles and mortars are found at all periods at Taxila. The mortar takes the form
of a cup with a shallow depression at the top and with a round or ﬂat base. The
pestle resembles a small, short muller worn at the ends instead of the sides. Both

are invariably made of hard stone such as abri, gneiss, hornblende, hornblende—
gneiss or syenite.

32. Bm. ’30—931; sq. 30-66’; stratum III. Cup-shaped mortar of hornblende-gneiss, with
ﬂat bottom. Diam. 8-12 in. (Pl. 140, q.)

33. Sk. ’16; Trench A254; stratum II. Cup—shaped mortar of hornblendevgneiss, with
rounded bottom. Diam. 4-5 in. (Pl. 140, t.)
34. Bin. ’19—I,485; sq. 10-36’; stratum IV. Pestle of hornblende; length 737 in.

Class XVIINa, b; ‘ Silverware ’, ch. 29, Class V

36. Bm. ’20—789; sq. 30-28’; stratum II. Part of rim of shallow dish of abrz' (lower cretaceous
shell limestone). Length 612 in.

37. Bm. ’19—1,333; sq. 5~62'; stratum II. Dish of ﬁne grey and white hornblende-gneiss,

ﬁne workmanship, turned on lathe. ,

39. Sk. ’29—2, 571; Block B’; sq. 36-89’; stratum V. Broken dish, resembling Greek phiale
mesomphalos, of grey micaceous schist, with central boss inside surrounded by concentric
circles. Diam. 8 in. Rim and upper part missing. Similar to certain earthenware, silver and
copper dishes with central boss (omphalos). For this and the following, cf. ‘Pottery’, ch. 23,
no. 109; ‘Silverware’, ch. 29, no. 10; ‘Copper and Bronze’, ch. 28, no. 289. (Pl. 140, u.)

schist; length 7 in. On inside, three concentric circles incised; on outside, foliate border in
relief; beneath, square projection with socket-hole for leg. A particularly attractive vessel of
Parthian date, in the Gandhara style. Cf. p. 190 supra. (Pl. 140, '0.)

CLASS VIII. Saucers (probably for toilet use; nos. 42~7). Cf. ‘Pottery’, ch. 23,
Class XV; ‘Iron’, ch. 27, Class IV; ‘Copper and Bronze’, ch. 28,

42. Bm. ’20—863; sq. 26-26’; stratum II. Saucer of pinkish white alabaster, turned on lathe.
Diam. 4-25 in. (Pls. 140, w; 143, p.)

43. Sk. ’I 3—I,21 5; Block E; sq. 74-52’; stratum II. Similar, of hornblende-gneiss, turned on
lathe. Diam. 4-37 in. Cf. p. 162, no. 7 supra.

Although this saucer was found in the Saka-Parthian stratum in Sirkap, it was probably older
by some two centuries or more. No other example of a vessel made of hard stone has been found
in Sirkap, and in this case the shape, and its blunted exterior mouldings, point to an earlier
date. Saucers of the Parthian period, if they have mouldings at 3.11, usually have them sharply
