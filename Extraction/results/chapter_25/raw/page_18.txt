CLASS XIV. Trays (nos. 62—97)

Nearly all the articles under this head belong to the class of round toilet—trays
usually divided into two or more compartments and embellished with ﬁgures or
scenes sculptured in relief. Besides this impOrtant series of toilet—trays there are
a few miniature trays of rock-crystal, emanating from the Bhir Mound, which in
all probability were also meant for the toilet table, and a larger tray of hornblende
micaceous schist from Sirkap, which was used no doubt for household purposes.

Type a. Toilet—trays. The ornamental toilet—trays are made of schist, steatite,
indurated claystone, slate or phyllite. Of the thirty—three specimens described
below, thirteen are of grey schist, eleven of micaceous schist, ﬁve of steatite, two
of indurated claystone, one of slate, and one of phyllite or phyllitic slate. No. 64,
which is probably of the Saka period, is of steatite, but with this exception all of
pre—Parthian date are of schist.

The subjects portrayed in these toilet-trays are not numerous. They comprise

tha11gh,as to the last it is perhaps more likely that this motif, so familiar in the
early Msthura School, may also have had a Hellenistic origin.

In point of style no. 62, which comes from the Graeco— Bactrian city, has a
distinctive character of its own, which apart from its place of ﬁnding would justify
us in assigning it to the second century B.C. Instead of this tray being divided up,
as nearly all the later examples are, into two or more compartments, the two
ﬁgures occupy the centre of the ﬁeld and stand out with effective simplicity against
the plain background. The ﬁgures themselves are treated almost as if they were in
the round, rather than in relief,3 and the modelling of their forms, albeit sketchy,

3 This characteristic of most Hellenistic relief work is shared also by the reliefs round the abacus

of the Asoka capital at Sarnath, which, as I have shown elsewhere, was executed by a Greek or a
I’erso~Greek artist of the third century B.C. Cf. C.H.I. vol. I, p. 621, and Marshall and Foucher,
