The double almond-shaped bezel calls to mind the rings with two, three or four hoops joined together at the base, but with separate bezels side by side, and it seems probable that the double bezel here may have been evolved from that type of ring.

They are engraved with various full-length ﬁgures and busts. The best in point of execution is a ﬁgure of Athens (10, f) with helmet, spear and shield, and a snake to left. Another draped and helmeted ﬁgure (10, a) may also be the same goddess, but what looks like a shield may be the badly drawn wing of a Nike. On h and 1' is portrayed a draped goddess with cornucopia, the one on the former being helmeted. This may perhaps be the same goddess that is ﬁgured in nos. I and 2 of the ‘Stone Sculptures’, ch. 36. On b and g are ﬁgures of the winged Nike, the former with the palm of victory between her legs instead of in her hand. The three remaining intaglios are very roughly executed busts. Their head-dresses, however, are interesting. Fig. d wears a plumed helmet with a curious projection above the rim in front; the other two (c and e) wear turbans with the same projection in front. All the intaglios, except a and f, are of such rough workman- ship that on grounds of style they might Well be attributed to the third or fourth century A.D.
