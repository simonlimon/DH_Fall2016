642 FINGER-RINGS AND GEMS [CH. 31

But in a few examples the decoration of the hoop is more elaborate. Thus in no. 23
the outer surface is rounded and gadrooned;I in no. 3 the devices on the hoop
consist of a pair of small ladybirds(?), a scorpion, swastika and leaf pattern; in
no. 1 I of a scorpion—like creature With a head at each end in the form of a nandipada ;
in no. 24 of a series of nine symbols sacred to both the Buddhists and the Jainas.
In these three examples there can be no doubt that the hoops, which are probably
of traditional Indian rather than Greek design, have a talismanic value. In no. IO,
on the other hand, the hoop of which is made up of rosettes and lozenges alternating,
and in no. 12, where it is composed of a broad openwork vine-scroll, the design
may be simply ornamental.

It remains to add that the inscriptions on the ﬁnger—rings appear in every
instance to give the name of the owner, usually in the genitive case.

Some general remarks on the ﬁnger-rings from the Bhir Mound will be found in
vol. I at pp. 103, 106—7, 111, and on the ﬁnger-rings from Sirkap at pp. 203~4.
Other references are given in the individual entries of the catalogue below.

CLASS I. Gold ﬁnger—rings (nos. 1—17)

The plain circlet of gold, no. 1, dates from the ﬁfth century A.D. The remaining
sixteen rings were found in the Saka—Parthian city on Sirkap in houses of the ﬁrst
century A.D., and the majority date no doubt from that century, but no. 16 and
possibly no. I4. also, both of which show signs of much wear and Which are more
solid than the others, may date from the ﬁrst century B.C., or even earlier.

Type a. Circlet of plain gold wire.

I . Plain hoop ﬁnger-ring of round gold wire. Diam. 0-81 in. Fifth century A.D. In. ’ 16—E 57;

Type I). With bezel of same metal. Hoop plain or decorated in relief.

2. Plain solid ﬁnger-ring of gold with ﬂattened oval bezel. Hoop ﬂat within, rounded

(Pl. 197, no. 2.)

3. Finger-ring of solid gold with projecting bezel in the form of a pair of almond-shaped
bosses. Diam. 0-87 in. The hoop consists of a ﬂat band of metal with beaded borders and
ﬁgures in relief on the outer surface, namely, a pair of tortoise-like creatures (perhaps lady-
birds) on either side of the bezel, followed by a scorpion, swastika and leaf design. The double
almond-shaped bezel calls to mind the rings with two, three or four hoops joined together at
the base, but with separate bezels side by side, and it seems probable that the double bezel
here may have been evolved from that type of ring. Cf. B.M. Cat. of Finger-rings, Pl. XLV,
type 7, and nos. 167—76. Sk. ’29—I,241 / 18. From same hoard as nos. 2 (q.v.) 9 and I7. Cf.
