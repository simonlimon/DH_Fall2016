to meet in front. Bm."21—-9 58; sq. 30-125’; stratum I. For type, cf. Flinders Petrie, Tools and
Weapons, Pl. XIX, 5, 12, 14, 25, etc. (P1. 169, no. 191.)

192. Socketed spud, with broader blade than preceding and open instead of closed socket.
Length 7- 37 in. First century A.D. The socket in this specimen consists of two narrow ﬂanges
bent only over the edges of the handle. Sk. ’20—654; Block B’; sq. 33-86’; stratum II. Cf.

Flinders Petrie, ibid. nos. 7, 10, 11, 18, etc. Cf. p. 194 supra. (Pl. 169, no. 192.)

193. Similar, but with broader blade and closed socket as in no. 191. Length 4-25 in. First
century A.D. Sk. ’24~91; Block C; sq. 47-41’; stratum 11. (P1. 169, no. 193.)

194. Similar to no. 193, but with open socket as in no. 192. Length 4-2 5 in. First century
A.D. Sk. ’16—3 12; Block B’; sq. 34-75’; stratum II. Cf. Flinders Petrie, ibid. nos. 32—3.
Cf. p. 194 supra. (P1. 169, no. 194.)

195. Spud(?) with widely splayed blade, probably socketed, but socket destroyed. Length

3- 5 in. Fifth century A.D.(P). Dh. ’16-545; mon. court A; 3 ft. below surface. Cf. p. 278

196. Spud or possibly ploughshare, with more pointed blade and side ﬂanges. Length

9-87 in. Fifth century A.D. From the Kunala monastery. Sk. ’26—Kun. 83; S 5; 4. ft. below

First century A.D. Sk. ’15—633; Block C; sq. 43- 59’; stratum III. (Pl. 169, no. 197.)

198. Spade, with double rings for socketing handle, and two rings for attachment of cord.
Size 8-12 x 6-37 in. First century A.D. The presence of the two side rings on the face of the
spade is of special interest as showing that the spade was intended to be used by two persons
for shovelling purposes, just as one sees such implements commonly used in India to—day—
one person holding the handle and pushing, the other holding the cord and pulling. Sk. ’14—

I,6o4.; Block C’; sq. 45-74’; stratum II. (P13. 169, no. 198; 2o5,j.)

cutting edge and united above by three transverse nails. Size 4-62 x 337 in. Fifth century A.D.
In. ’16—F47; mon. court. Wooden spades shod with iron were used also by the Romans and

Normans. Cf. Flinders Petrie, op. cit. p. 55 and P1. LXVII, 20, 23. Cf. p. 385 supra. (Pl. 169,

no. 199).
C L A s S XXXVIII. Weeding-f0rks( 9) (nos. 200—2)

The three following implements were almost certainly used as weeding-forks,
but similar implements have been taken for forked arrow-heads for shooting birds
and small game. Cf. Flinders Petrie, op. cit. p. 35, and P1. XLI, 167—9. The fork is
provided with a tang which ﬁtted into a wooden handle (or shaft) and was further
secured by a nail. Two of them date from the ﬁrst century A.D. The date of the

third is uncertain.

CLASS XXXIX. Sickles (nos. 203—7)

The earliest sickles found at Taxila date from the ﬁrst century A.D., though they
must'have been in use for many centuries before then. When they do appear, they
