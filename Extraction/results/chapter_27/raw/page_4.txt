Specimen no.

Micro-examination

 

I

 

 

Micro no. 8134. Structure consists of small slightly elongated grains of ferrite and
spheroidal carbide, the result of decomposition of the pearlite. The grains are
outlined by cementite. Traces only of decarburisation round the outer surface.
Non-metallic inclusions fairly small and comparatively few.

Micro no. 8135. Structure similar to specimen 1, but cell walls of cementite
thicker and grains larger and more elongated. Slight partial decarburisation of
the surfaces. Non-metallic inclusions similar to those in specimen no. 1.

,Micro no. 8136. Shows a core of small ferrite and pearlite grains, corresponding
to material of 0-15—0-25 % C. surrounded by a skin 0-1-0-25 mm. in thickness of
coarse columnar-shaped grains of ferrite. Non—metallic inclusions moderately
large and numerous.

 

 

Sir Robert Hadﬁeld remarks on the above: ‘The very low sulphur content in the two specimens
analysed is in accordance with our experience with practically all previous Indian specimens. The
phosphorus content is rather low compared with many of these previous specimens, one of which ran as
high as o-303. At the same time there have been specimens (no. 2441—Khambaba) as low as 0-020.
