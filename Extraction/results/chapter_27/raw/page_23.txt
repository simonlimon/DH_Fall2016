562 IRON OBJECTS [CH. 27

measuring between 475 and 7-12 in. in length by 1-3 to 2- 5 in. in width at the
middle. Their small size might suggest that the metal of which they are composed
was of a superior quality, but analysis has shown that this is not so.

217. 105 ingots, six-Sided torpedo-shaped, with truncated ends. Length 475—6 5 in.
Weight from 1-5 to 4-2 lb. First century AD. Sk. ’28—1,141; Block D’; sq. 62.104'; stratum II.
Cf. p. 190 supra. (Pl. 170, i.)

218. Similar. Length 6-62 in. First century A.D. Sk. ’14—1,593; Block C’; sq. 46-74’;
stratum II. Cf. p. 193 supra. (Pl. 170, l.)

219. Similar and of same age. Length 712 in. Sk. ’24—5 14; Block C; sq. 49-51’; stratum III.
(Pl. 170, n.)

220. Similar and of same age, but pointed at one end. Length 5-12 in. Sk. ’20—741;
Block D’; sq. 61-86’; stratum I. Cf. p. 190 supra. (Pl. 170, k.)

221. Similar but broader in middle and pointed at both ends. Length 7 in. Date uncertain.
Dh. ’14—984; B27; 3 ft. below surface. (Pl. 170, m.)

Below is a report (T9073 of 1 I July 1938) on the analyses and tests of specimens
of these ingots (no. 217) carried out in the Hadﬁeld Research Dept. at Sheffield.

1. Six ingots were received, weighing individually from 1 lb. 117} oz. to 3 lb. 7% oz. The
ingots were spindle—shaped, roughly hexagonal in section.

2. Analyses and tests were made on one of the ingots of medium weight, 2 lb. 15 02., 6 in.
long and 1-9 in. at its greatest width.

GENERAL CHARACTER

4. A complete longitudinal section showed the ingot to be very porous, some of the holes
being 4% in. in maximum dimension.

MECHANICAL TESTS
Hardness

5. The standard diamond pyramid hardness ﬁgures over the section varied between 70 and
129, with an average of 95.

6. The hardness ﬁgures are mostly only approximate because of the irregular shape of the
impressions. Several other determinations were discarded for this reason.

Tensile test

7. A small bar, 4% in. in diameter, was forged from the soundest portion of the ingot, and a
tensile test made on the bar Without further heat treatment, with results as follows:
