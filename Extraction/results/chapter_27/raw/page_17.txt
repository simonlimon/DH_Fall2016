CLASS XXI. Armour, helmet and shield bosses (nos. 90—5)

90. Eighteen armour plates of iron much corroded and adhering together, along with three
links of an iron chain. Size about 10 x85 x -08 in. thick. Sk. ’28«1,782; Block F’; sq. 85'89’;
stratum II. The plates are curved to ﬁt the body and are of different sizes and patterns; some
of their edges are straight, others curvilinear, While Some are provided with hinges or pierced
with small holes for lacing. The plates are so corroded that there is no possibility of separating
them, but enough is visible to show that each was made up of several strips of metal, probably
hammered together. It is not possible to determine for certain if they were riveted. Rectangular
armour plates, either of iron or of lacquered leather, are ﬁgured on the skirts of soldiers in certain
Gandhara reliefs (cf. Foucher, L’Art gre’co-bouda'hique du Gandhara, p. 405, ﬁgs. 202, 204),
but the size and weight of these plates from Sirkap suggests that they served as armour for
horses or even for camelsI or elephants, rather than for men. Horses and riders clad in mail or
plate armour were from early times a feature of the Persian, Seleucid, Parthian and Sarmatian
armies. A horseman with an armoured apron protecting his legs is ﬁgured on coins of the
Saka satrap, Kharahostes (RM. Cat. of Greek and Scythic coins of Bactria and India, Pl. XXIII, 6).
About the second century A.D. the idea was also copied by the Romans, to whom this class of
heavy cavalry was known as the cataphracti (Koc'r0'(q>pom-1’01).I Cf. Xenophon, Anal). 1, 8, 6~7;
Cyropaedia, VI, 4, 1; VII, 1,2; VIII, 8, 11; Tit. Liv. XXIV, 48; XXXVII, 40; Polyb. 31, 3, 9; Plut.

I The Parthian camelry, which was also heavily armed, may have been copied from the Roman
dromedarii. The idea of the cataphract also spread eastward to China as early, probably, as the ﬁrst
century B.C. Cf. Laufer, Chinese Clay Figures (1914), p. 217.
