CLASS XXVI. Chisels (nos. 118—21, 0)

Iron Chisels are few in number. The earliest example from the Bhir Mound
(third to second century B.C.) is a bare metal, square bar tool, with splayed single-
slope cutting edge, intended no doubt for mortising work. Of the Chisels from
Sirkap (second century B.C. and ﬁrst century A.D.), some (type b) are bare metal,
round bar tools for stone-cutting; others (type e) are bare metal round bar car-
penter’s Chisels, tapering gradually from the top downwards to a splayed crescentic
edge.

Type a:

I 18. Bare metal chisel for mortising, approximately square in section, with single slope and
slightly splayed crescentic cutting edge. Length 5 in. Bm. ’21—636; sq. 132'94'; stratum II.
(Pl. 166, no. 118.)

Type b:
119. Bare metal, round bar chisel, with double slope and straight cutting edge, for stone-

cutting. Length 575 in. Sk. ’22—920; Block 1’; sq. 12'92’; stratum V. Second century B.C.
