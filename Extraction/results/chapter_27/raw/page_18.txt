91, a, b. Two groups of plate armour intended for the arms. They consist of twenty—four
and eighteen pieces respectively, of varying sizes and shapes. The heavy weight of the metal
suggests that the armour was designed for a horseman rather than a foot-soldier. Sk. ’26—3,63 I ;
Block K; sq. 157-61’; stratum II. First century AD. Cf. p. I76 supra. (Pl. 170, p, q.)

92. Helmet with cheek—piece (ndpayvoreis) on one side, attached seemingly by pivot,
enabling it to he raised or lowered. The other side of the helmet is missing. Length 9- 5 in.;
Width 7 in.; height 6 in. The crown is of one piece, beaten out like an oval bowl and afterwards
deepened by means of horizontal bands hammered on to it. It is large enough to admit of
a thick padded cap underneath, even on a big head. On the summit is a boss intended for

the attachment of a ring, spike or crest (Moos). Cf. Dar. et Sag. so. ‘Galea’, and ﬁg. 3428.

Sk. stratum II. (Pl. 170, r.)

GROUP C. HORSE-BRIDLES AND ELEPHANT-GOADS
CLASS XXII. Bits and cheek—bars of horse-bridles (nos. 96~Ioo)

Ancient horse—bits were generally of three kinds, Viz.: (a) the simple plain or
jointed snaﬂIe-bit; (b) the protected snafﬂe, with a ring or cheek-bar at each side
to prevent the rein slipping into the mouth; (c) the‘curb-bit, with a curb-chain or
strap fastened to the upper ends of the cheek-bars and passing under the horse’s
lower jaw, while the reins are attached to the lower ends of the cheek—bars. (Cf.
Flinders Petrie, Tools and Weapons, pp. 55, 56, and Pls. LXX, LXXI; Eucy. Brit. so
‘ Saddlery ’ ; Dar. et Sag. so. ‘ Frenum ’.) The bits found at Taxila are of (a) and (1))
types only. They date from the ﬁrst century A.D. Arrian says that in the time of
Alexander the Great the Indians did not curb their horses with bits like those
in use among the Greeks and Kelts, but they ﬁtted round the horse’s mouth a
circular piece of OX—hide studded with iron or brass pricks pointing inwards but
not very sharp; and Within the horse’s mouth they put an iron prong like a skewer,
to which the reins were attached, so that when the rider pulled the reins, the prong
controlled the horse and the pricks inside the muzzle goaded its mouth, compelling
it to obey the reins.I That the Greeks introduced the snafﬂe—bit into India is
corroborated by the fact that the Sanskrit word for ‘bit’=khaliua, is borrowed
from the Greek XCXNVéS. The spiked bit is still all too familiar in the North-West,

‘ Cf. Arrian, Ind. 16. Strabo (XV, 66) says: ‘Instead of bridles they use muzzles, which differ little
from halters and the lips are perforated with spikes.’
