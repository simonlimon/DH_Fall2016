but no examples of it have been found at Taxila. Cheek-bars of horn and bone
have also been found at Taxila (ch. 32, nos. 115—17).

96. Snaﬂle-bit, jointed in middle, with cheek—rings made in one piece with each section
of the bar. The bar is plain. Length 8-62 in. Sk. ’14—1, 593; Block C’; sq. 46-74’; stratum II.
Cf. p. 193 supra. (Pls. 165, no. 96; 205, c.)

97. Similar; length 7- 5 in. Sk. ’14—384; Block K; sq. 154—47’; stratum II. Cf. p. 176 supra.
(Pl. 165, no. 97.)

98. Similar; length 7-87 in. Sk. ’26—21; Block]; sq. 14.3-69’; stratum II. Cf. p. 171 supra.
(Pl. 165, no. 98.)

99. An S—shaped cheek-bar of horse—bridle with two holes for rein-strap. The cheek-bar
was attached to the bit, in the manner illustrated in P1. 20 5, b, which shows a horn cheek-bar
and bit from Central Asia. Length 5- 5 in. Sk. ’14.; Trench A627. For S-shaped bars, cf.
Flinders Petrie, op. cit. p. 56, §158 and P1. LXX, 19, 20, and Lefebure des Noettes, L’Attelage,
Le Cheval a'e Selle, ﬁgs. 24.7 and 248 (Scythian and Roman), and for earlier and more decorative
specimens in bronze from Luristan, Illus. London News (6 Sept. 1930), p. 389, ﬁgs. 3—10.
(Pl. 170, 0.)

100, a, b. Two cheek-bars similar to above, but slightly curved instead of being S—shaped.
Length 6-75 in. and 7-25 in. respectively. Sk. ’14—2,276; Block E; sq. 69-66’; stratum III.
Cf. p. 161 (16) supra. (P15. 165, no. 100, a, b; 185, d.)

CLASS XXIII. Elephant-goads (nos. 101, 102)

Somewhat similar implements to those described below are designated ‘ﬁre-
hooks’ by Flinders Petrie and said to have been used in Egypt for raking the
charcoal in the braziers (cf. Flinders Petrie, Tools and Weapons, Pl. LXXI, 50, 51).
There is no reason, however, to suppose that the following implements were other
than the familiar arikus’a ﬁgured so often in early Indian sculptures. It is note-
worthy that precisely the same type of elephant-goad was used in North Africa.
See, for example, the Carthaginian coin in the Cabinet de France, illustrated in
Dar. et Sag. s.v. ‘Elephas’, ﬁg. 2621.

101. Elephant-goad (Skr. arikus’a) with sharp point at end and curved hook at side. Length
25-5 in. Bm. ’24—212; sq. 7-61’; stratum II. (P1. 170, v.)

102. Similar. Length 5- 5 in. Sk. ’22—611; Block C’; sq. 51-90’; stratum III. First century
B.C. to ﬁrst century AD. Cf. p. 193 supra. (Pl. 170, u.)

CLASS XXIV. Axes (nos. 103—1 1)

All the iron axes from Taxila belong to the socketed class. One only (no. 103)
comes from the Bhir Mound and is referable to the third to second century B.C.;
the rest come from Sirkap and date from the ﬁrst century AD. The commonest is
a true iron type (a) with a Wide splay and thin blade, such as is frequently met with
at Pompeii and on other Roman sites at this period. Cf. Flinders Petrie, Tools and
Weapons, p. 11 and P1. IX, 26—36. In the Sirkap specimens the droop of the blade
tends to become more marked, giving the axe a broader crescentic edge and enabling
it to make a longer cut. In another type (b) the blade is prolonged in both directions,
