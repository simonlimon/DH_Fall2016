GENERAL REMAR KS

IO. In their chemical analysis these ingots are fairly representative of the many Indian iron
specimens, obtained from various locations, which we have examined.

1 I. Phosphorus contents as low as 0-015 % were found in chippings from the iron beams at
Konarak, and as high as 028% in the fragment from the iron pillar or beam at Dhar.

I2. Sulphur analysed as low as 0-002% in tools found in Dekhan, but as high as 0-024% in
the Konarak beams, with a general average of o'oog%.

13. The sulphur, 0'019% , in the present ingots, therefore, is rather above the average.

14. It may be recalled, however, that the iron implements from Taxila examined on a
previous occasion contained from 0.024 to 0-064% of phosphorus, and only o-oo4—o-oos%
of sulphur.

15. Apparently, therefore, the ingot now examined is individually, as regards its sulphur
content, rather higher than the general average of the iron produced at Taxila.

16. Our examination does not indicate any special qualities in this iron above that produced
in other parts of India, recognising, however, that, judged by ordinary standards, Indian iron
is in general of excellent purity.
