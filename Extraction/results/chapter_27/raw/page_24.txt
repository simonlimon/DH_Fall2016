CLASS XXXIII. Nails, nail—bosses and hooks (nos. 150—66)

A curious type of nail (a) found only in the Bhir Mound and dating from the
third to second century B.C. has a broad ﬂat head of varying shape with a small
round hole perforated from side to side at the upper edge. The purpose of the
hole is not apparent; it might be intended to take a wire or string. Of nails with
heads turned over at right angles to the shank (type b) no. 152 is of the third to
second century B.C.; no. I 53 of the ﬁfth century A.D. Nos. 154—6 with heavy boss
heads all come from Sirkap and date from the ﬁrst century A.D. They were prob—
ably used for studding door—fronts but might also have served as beak—irons for
light metal—work. Beak-irons with single spikes, like these, for ﬁxing into a
wooden block, were in use among Roman artiﬁcers (cf. Dar. et Sag. 3.22. ‘Incus’,
ﬁg. 4037). The ornamental door-bosses of iron, held in place by a centre nail
(nos. 157—62), come partly from strata of the ﬁrst century A.D. in Sirkap, partly
from the ﬁfth-century monasteries at Jauliaﬁ and the Dharmarajika. Such
bosses were more commonly made of copper or bronze than of iron (cf. ‘ Copper

and Bronze’, ch. 28, nos. 408—I2). Hooks (nos. 163—6) are of two types, viz. :7
(a) a rigid hook driven into the woodwork of the ceiling, for hanging things on;
(b) movable hooks used in conjunction with staples as door-fasteners.

Type a:

150, a, b. Two nails, with ﬂat shanks and broad ﬂat heads projecting to one side of the
shank. At its upper edge the head is perforated from side to side by a small round hole.
Length 4-87 and 4-45 in. respectively. Third to second century B.C. Bm. ’21—144; sq. 11-51’;
stratum II. (Pl. 167, no. 150, a, b.)
