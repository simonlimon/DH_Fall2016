Without exception, all the arrow—heads found at Taxila were intended for shafts made of reeds, not of solid wood, and were provided accordingly with long tangs instead of hollow sockets.I But a peculiarity of nearly all the earlier specimens is that there is a considerable length of solid shank intervening between the head and the tang. The explanation of this unusual feature seems to be that this type of arrow-head is a compromise between the socketed and tanged varieties. Whoever its authors may have been, they had «evidently been accustomed to socketed piles designed for solid wooden shafts, and when, for some reason or other, reeds were substituted for the solid wood, the old form of pile was retained and a thin tang added behind the shank for insertion into the reed, the shank itself being made solid instead of hollow. Since the reed arrow was in general use among Iranian and Central Asian2 as well as Indian peoples, it is reasonable to infer that these ‘double-tanged’ heads, as we may call them, were an adaptation of a Western sdcketed type rather than an Eastern one, and, this being so, it seems not improbable that they were introduced at Taxila by the Bactrian Greeks. In support of this surmise it is to be noted-that the earliest specimens come from the uppermost stratum of the Bhir Mound and are therefore contemporary with the advent of the Bactrian Greeks. No iron arrow—heads of any kind have been found in the earlier settlements on this site,3 although they must, of course, have been in use. Apart from their double tang, the arrow-heads from the Bhir Mound belong to ﬁve different types, Viz.: (a) ﬂat, with lozenge cross-section; (b) with triangular cross—section; (c) with square cross-section; (a0 with rhombic cross-section; (e) barbed. With the exception of (b) all these types recur in the later settlements in Sirkap, but in the Saka—Parthian period (ﬁrst century 3.0. to ﬁrst century A.D.) two new types also make their appearance, viz.: (f) conical, and (g) three—bladed. The older types of arrow—heads also tend to become larger, e.g. nos. 77, 78, 84. In the ﬁfth century A.D. an eighth type (h) with four barbed blades was introduced.4 1 Indian arrows seem to have been Usually made of the s’ara reed, but arrows made of bambu (veﬂu) and s’ala‘ka (a hard wood) are also mentioned in Indian literature, e.g. Kautilya, Arthas’astra, bk. 11, ch. I3; Agni Parana, 245, 12. 2 Cf. Excavations at Dura-Europos, 6th season (1932—3), p. 454, and notes 48 and 49; Stein, Innermost Asia, I, pp. 95—6; III, Pls. VI, XXVI, XLVII; Serindia, Iv, Pls. LI, LIII, etc. The Indian reed—arrow was from two to three cubits in length. Cf. Q. Curtius, VIII, 9; Arrian, Ind. c. 16; Strabo, XV, 66. 3 For a double-tanged arrow-head with three blades from Turfan (Kara-khoja), see Stein, op. cit. II, p. 608, Kao IV, OI and vol. III, Pl. LXXI. The author, however, does not attempt to explain the peculiarity of the type. 4 Ancient Indian literature refers to arrow-heads of many shapes, e.g. ardhacandra (‘ half-moon ’), kshurapra (with a razor-edge), sﬁcimukha (needle—shaped), vatsa-danta (like a calf’s tooth), etc. Cf. j.A.O.S. XIII, pp. 275—81. 548 IRON OBJECTS [011. 27 The three-bladed type (g) seems to have been specially favouredlby the Sakas,I to whom its introduction at Taxila was no doubt due. It is noteworthy, however, that many specimens of this three—bladed, as well as of the four—bladed type, have been found along with specimens of (a) and (d) types at the Dharmarajika and other monasteries destroyed by the White Huns in the ﬁfth century AD. It is a reasonable surmise that the former weapons were used by the attacking Huns; the latter, which were traditional at TaXila, by the defending monks, though the three- bladed type, which had long before been introduced by the Sakas, may also have been used by the defenders.

The plates are curved to ﬁt the body and are of different sizes and patterns; some of their edges are straight, others curvilinear, While Some are provided with hinges or pierced with small holes for lacing. The plates are so corroded that there is no possibility of separating them, but enough is visible to show that each was made up of several strips of metal, probably hammered together. It is not possible to determine for certain if they were riveted. Rectangular armour plates, either of iron or of lacquered leather, are ﬁgured on the skirts of soldiers in certain Gandhara reliefs (cf. Foucher, L’Art gre’co-bouda'hique du Gandhara, p. 405, ﬁgs. 202, 204), but the size and weight of these plates from Sirkap suggests that they served as armour for horses or even for camelsI or elephants, rather than for men. Horses and riders clad in mail or plate armour were from early times a feature of the Persian, Seleucid, Parthian and Sarmatian armies. A horseman with an armoured apron protecting his legs is ﬁgured on coins of the Saka satrap, Kharahostes (RM. Cat. of Greek and Scythic coins of Bactria and India, Pl. XXIII, 6). About the second century A.D. the idea was also copied by the Romans, to whom this class of heavy cavalry was known as the cataphracti (Koc'r0'(q>pom-1’01).I Cf.

HORSE-BRIDLES AND ELEPHANT-GOADS Ancient horse—bits were generally of three kinds, Viz.: (a) the simple plain or jointed snaﬂIe-bit; (b) the protected snafﬂe, with a ring or cheek-bar at each side to prevent the rein slipping into the mouth; (c) the‘curb-bit, with a curb-chain or strap fastened to the upper ends of the cheek-bars and passing under the horse’s lower jaw, while the reins are attached to the lower ends of the cheek—bars. (Cf. Flinders Petrie, Tools and Weapons, pp. 55, 56, and Pls. LXX, LXXI; Eucy. Brit. so ‘ Saddlery ’ ; Dar. et Sag. so. ‘ Frenum ’.) The bits found at Taxila are of (a) and (1)) types only. They date from the ﬁrst century A.D. Arrian says that in the time of Alexander the Great the Indians did not curb their horses with bits like those in use among the Greeks and Kelts, but they ﬁtted round the horse’s mouth a circular piece of OX—hide studded with iron or brass pricks pointing inwards but not very sharp; and Within the horse’s mouth they put an iron prong like a skewer, to which the reins were attached, so that when the rider pulled the reins, the prong controlled the horse and the pricks inside the muzzle goaded its mouth, compelling it to obey the reins.I That the Greeks introduced the snafﬂe—bit into India is corroborated by the fact that the Sanskrit word for ‘bit’=khaliua, is borrowed from the Greek XCXNVéS. The spiked bit is still all too familiar in the North-West, ‘ Cf. Arrian, Ind. 16.

Carpenter’s and blacksmith’s tools and agricultural implements (Groups D and E) were least likely, perhaps, to be affected by foreign innovations, but it is noteworthy that even among them scissors (no. I 3 5) and the spade (no. 198) made their ﬁrst appearance at Taxila in the ﬁrst century A.D., about the same time that they did in the Mediterranean area. Probably in no country of the world is iron found more abundantly than in India, and in» none are the ores from which it is extracted of greater purity or more easily accessible. Once, therefore, that the use of iron had been discovered and its advantages over copper and its alloys proved, Indians could have had little difﬁculty in obtaining adequate supplies of the metal. Indeed, the sources from which it might have been traded to T axila are so many, that there would be small purpose in naming them. From a very early period India was famous for the high quality of its iron and steel. Thus Ktesias, who was at the court of Persia in the ﬁfth century 13.0., mentions two remarkable swords of Indian steel presented to him by the king of Persia and his mother, and it has been plausibly sug- gested that the fermm candidum of which the Malloi presented a hundred talents’ weight to Alexander the Great, was the same metal. Again, the Periplus informs us that in the ﬁrst century A.D. Indian iron and steel were being ex— ported from Ariaca (Gulf of Cambay and thereabouts) to Abyssinia, and ferrnm Indicum also ﬁgures in the lists of dutiable articles under Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. Salmasius, too, speaks of a Greek treatise (now lost) on the tempering of Indian steel. Of the fame enjoyed by Indian steel in medieval and later times there is no less evidence. Writing in the twelfth century, Idrisi says: ‘ The Hindus excel in the [ manufacture of iron. They have also workshops wherein are forged the most famous sabres in the world. It is impossible to ﬁnd anything to surpass the edge that you get from Indian steel.’ In the following century Marco Polo speaks of iron and ondanique in the markets of Kerman, and the latter has been recognised by Yule as a corruption of the Persian hundwa'niy (=Indian steel), which was used for the far-famed sword blades of Kerman. Tavernier, again (1605—80), writes: ‘The steel susceptible of being damascened comes from the kingdom of Golconda; it is met with in commerce in lumps about the size of a halfpenny cake; they are cut in two in order to see whether they are of good quality, and each makes half the blade of a sabre.’ (Cf. McCrindle, Ancient India, its invasion by Alexander the Great, p. 252 and n. I; Schoff, The Periplus of the Erythrcean Sea, ch. 6, pp. 24, 70, I72; Neogi, Iron in Ancient India, pp. 66—8; Marco Polo (ed. Yule), bk. I, ch. XVII; Tavernier (ed. Ball), 1, 157.) The literary evidence as to the excellence of ancient Indian iron and steel has been fully corroborated by the analysis and micro—examination of selected speci- mens from TaXila and Besnagar.

AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS The true spade (no. 198) does not make its appearance at TaXila until the ﬁrst century A.D.-—about the same time that it makes its appearance in the Roman world—and was then only used for shovelling purposes. For breaking and hoeing the ground the ordinary tool was a socketed hoe or mattock, shaped like the modern krurpi, with the handle set transversely to the blade. The older specimens of these tools from the Bhir Mound (nos. 182—4) have narrow chisel—like blades, and this type continues on into later times; but some of the later specimens of the ﬁrst century A.D. from Sirkap have broader blades, like the English garden hoe. Side by side with the hoe, a chisel-headed spud was also used at TaXila as far back as the third to second centuries B.C. (no. 191 infra). Later on, this tool, like the hoe also, tends to become broader in the blade. It should be noted that the tools which I here class as spuds, to be used with a vertical handle like a Dutch hoe, or spade, ‘ are classed by Flinders Petrie as ordinary hoes to be used with a transverse handle (cf. Tools and Weapons, Pls. XIX and XX), but inasmuch as the tools described below (nos. 182—90) are unquestionably hoes with transverse handles, it is highly im— probable that nos. 191—5, which are of a totally different pattern, were intended to be used in the same way as hoes.",168-181,Sk,,1917

Three of them (nos. 1, 2, 5) show a very high carbon percentage, between 1-2 and 17 % (which is about double that of the Khambaba specimens), and leave no doubt that high carbon steel was being knowingly made as such at this period in India. On the other hand, it is a matter of surprise that these specimens show no signs of having been tempered. The absence of such tempering in a single or even in two specimens might perhaps be explained on the hypothesis that they were newly made and unused and for that reason had not yet been tempered, but this explanation could hardly be true of all three specimens, and we must therefore conclude that the makers of these objects were either ignorant of the process of tempering or did not think it necessary to temper steel of such high quality. Seeing, however, how close were the relations at this time between Taxila and the Western world, it seems scarcely possible that the art of tempering could have been unknown there. As to the process by which this ancient steel was produced, it was probably the same as that by which the celebrated wootz steel is still produced—or was, at any rate, being produced until a recent date———in the South of India. In this process, which is known as ‘cementation’, wrought iron is ﬁrst obtained by the direct method, viz. by heating the ores of iron with charcoal in small blast furnaces (the blast being produced by means of hand-bellows) without the intermediate forma— tion of cast iron. ‘The wrought iron is then cut into small pieces and placed in crucibles along with certain kinds of wood and leaves of plants, and then heated in charcoal blast furnaces with the lids closed. The blast is continued from four to six hours, when the steel is obtained in a molten condition. Water is then sprinkled or poured on the metal, Which is thus hardened on being quenched and the steel is obtained in a crystalline condition.’ (Neogi, Iron in Ancient India, p. 72. Cf. also Dar. et Sag. so. ‘Ferrum’, p. 1093, and for further particulars of the process, Heyne, Tracts on India, historical and statistical, p. 359; Buchanan, Travels from Madras through Mysore, etc., vol. I, pp. 118, 306; vol. II, pp. 20, 118, 308; Percy, Metallurgy, vol. 11, p. 778.) Tavernier’s remarks quoted above about Indian steel being traded in lumps ‘ of the size of a halfpenny cake’, agree with what H. G. Graves says concerning the blooms used for forging the iron beams at Konarak, which according to his measurements averaged some 6 in. in length by 1—2 in. in cross-section and weighed from three to four pounds,2 but it is to be noted that the latter are of iron, not of steel. The 108 ingots found in Sirkap and described below (nos. 217—20) are of much the same size and weight, averaging about 5-4 X 1-4 in. and weighing from 1% to 4 lb. 1 Cf. A.S.R.

Below is a report (T 9073 of I I July 1938) on the analyses and tests of specimens of these ingots (no. 217) carried out in the Hadﬁeld Research Dept. at Shefﬁeld. 1. Six ingots were received, weighing individually from 1 1b. 11% oz. to 3 lb. 7% oz. The ingots were spindle—shaped, roughly hexagonal in section. 2. Analyses and tests were made on one of the ingots of medium weight, 2 1b. 15 oz., 6 in. long and 1-9 in. at its greatest width. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS (per cent) 3. C Si S P Mn Fe 0-10 0-03 0-019 0-077 Trace 99-6 GENERAL CHARACTER 4. A complete longitudinal section showed the ingot to be very porous, some of the holes being 4% in. in maximum dimension. MECHANICAL TESTS Hardness 5. The standard diamond pyramid hardness ﬁgures over the section varied between 70 and 129, with an average of 95. 6. The hardness ﬁgures are mostly only approximate because of the irregular shape of the impressions. Several other determinations were discarded for this reason. Tensile test 7. A small bar, % in. in diameter, was forged from the soundest portion of the ingot, and a tensile test made on the bar without further heat treatment, with results as follows: Yield point Maximum stress Elongation’X‘ Reduction of area Tons per sq. in. per cent rWMM—c—ﬁ k—M— \ 16-1 22-8 15-5 43-0 * Length + Jarea = 4. 8.

Non—metallic inclusions moderately large and numerous.     Sir Robert Hadﬁeld remarks on the above: ‘The very low sulphur content in the two specimens analysed is in accordance with our experience with practically all previous Indian specimens. The phosphorus content is rather low compared with many of these previous specimens, one of which ran as high as o-303. At the same time there have been specimens (no. 2441—Khambaba) as low as 0-020. CH. 27] IRON OBJECTS 537 ‘The chief feature of the present specimens is the high carbon percentage, 1-23, in no. 5. The Brinell hardness and the micro-structure of nos. I and. 2 also indicate they are of similar high carbon. We have never come across any ancient specimens as high as this before. The highest was 07 carbon in the Kham— bﬁba specimen, 2441, and this was so exceptional that we thought at the time it must be a ﬂuke. ‘ Evidently the Indians in this locality (T axila), and at this period, quite deliberately made high carbon steel. But apparentlywthey did not know how to harden and temper. If they had, the two swords, specimens I and 2, and the adze (no. 5) would be just the articles to apply this treatment to. The micro gives no indication of anything more than the ordinary heating for forging, and of course the hardness is only ordinary. ’ ‘The specimens with low carbon, if no. 3 can be taken as representative of these, contain the usual amount of non-metallic inclusions. The high carbon specimens are, however, comparatively clean.’ TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION OF IRON OBJECTS                   IN SIRKAP Block Strata VI—V Stratum IV Strata III—II Stratum I Greek Early Saka Saka-Parthian Surface EAST SIDE OF MAIN STREET I — * 45, 62 78 A _. __ __ __ B —- —- 36, 2I3 154, 155 C — ~— 107, 109, 121, b, 142, 190, 193, —— 197, 219 D _ __ _ __ E —— 84 11, 100,11, b, 129 — F —- 211 — —— G — # 69, 146, 157 200 H —— —— 9, 105, 121, c, 188 ~— I —- — 24, 38, 43, 49, 54, 77, 87, 126,172, 6, 49, I44 203, 207 ' J —— —— V 10, 68, 98, 108 111 K _‘ _ 41: 4'4: 4'8) 91: 97) 1‘16, 125’ I33) ‘— 137, 139, 2116 L —— -—~ 58, 132, 138, I40, 141, a—c, 148, —— 214, 215 WEST SIDE or MAIN STREET 1’ I19 - I3, I45 —- A’ ~- ——- 2, 4, 120, 149, 186, 212 — B’ -— 29 / 3, no, 192, I94 37 C’ — — 35,95,96,102,124,185,I98,218 — D’ — 22 14, 15, 18, 42, (1—3;, 88, 94., 104, 220 147, 158, 217 E, 'T' ’— I) I7; 20: 33: 57’ 106 _ F’ ~—— — 5, 60, 61, 90, 162, 201 — G’ —- — 156 7 ~— H’ _ __ . _. __ K, '_"" '— 537 93) 18° '— Main Street —- —- 30, 115, 121, a, 187 ' ~— Fifth Street (west) — —— 65, 66 — Note.
