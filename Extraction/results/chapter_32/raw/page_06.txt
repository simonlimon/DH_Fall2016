30. Similar, with head in form of cock standing on abacus. Length 237 in. Sk. ’29—2,I46;
Block A; sq. 23-45’; stratum III. Cf. p. 146 supra. (Pl. 206, no. I4.)

31. Similar to no. 26, but lower part of pin missing. Length 3-37 in. Sk. ’24—419; Block C;
sq. 41-48’; stratum II. Cf. p. 149, no. 5 supra. (Pl. 206, no. 13.)

32. Similar to no. 30, but the cock is mounted on a capital instead of abacus only. Length
3-37 in. Sk. ’24—62; Block C; sq. 41- 51’; stratum II. Cf. p. 149, no. 5 supra. (Pl. 206,
no. 17.)

33. Similar to no. 28; head in form of pot with three incised circles beneath. Length 3- 18 in.
Sk. ’15—370; Block E; sq. 77-49’; stratum II. Cf. p. 162, no. 17 supra. (Pl. 199, no. 33 and
P1. 206, no. 22.)

34. Head of bone object of a wave pattern somewhat resembling no. 29, but without the
side projections. Length 287 in. At the top is a groove with three holes for rivets; the shaft
at the other end is broken. It may have been either a hair-pin or a knife-handle. In the former
case, the groove and rivet holes may have been meant for the attachment of an additional
ornament, possibly of metal. Sk. ’15—813; Block C; sq. 45- 59’; stratum II. Cf. p. 149,
no. 2 supra. (P1. 199, no. 34.)

CLASS VII. Antimony-rods, ear-cleaners and toothpicks (nos. 3 5~42)

These are classiﬁed under one head, as two of them are frequently combined
together. They take the form of short rods of bone, ivory, copper, bronze or lead,
measuring from 3 to 6 in. in length. If required for smearing antimony or kohl
round the eyes the rod is slightly clubbed; if required as a toothpick or nail-
cleaner, it is pointed; if as an ear-cleaner, it is furnished with a tiny scoop. Some
of the rods are clubbed at both ends; others have a club at one end and a point or
scoop at the other; others have a point at one end and a scoop at the other. The
earliest specimens found at Taxila date from the third, or possibly fourth, century
3.0.; the latest from the ﬁrst century AD. In the earliest specimens from the Bhir
Mound, bone or ivory is used for the simple clubbed antimony-rod, copper for the
antimony-rod and ear-cleaner combined. In the later specimens from Sirkap,
bone, ivory, copper, bronze and lead are used for the antimony-rods; bone, ivory
and copper for the combination of ear-cleaner and toothpick; and copper only for
the combination of antimony-rod and toothpick. The combination of antimony-rod
and ear-cleaner has not been found in Sirkap. Antimony-rods or kohl—sticks, as
they are sometimes called, were used in Egypt and the West from a very early
age, and it is not unlikely that they and the ear-cleaners were introduced at
TaXila by the Greeks. The usual Greek word for antimony was G'riuut or oﬁul.
Ear-cleaners were called o’o'royluois by the Greeks, auriscalpz'um by the Romans.
The clubbed antimony-rod was doubtless used also for ordinary painting under
the eyes with lamp-black (é’toﬂohos). See ‘ Copper and Bronze’, Class VIII,
nos. 212—25, where references are given to similar Egyptian and Roman
objects.
