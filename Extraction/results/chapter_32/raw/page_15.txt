666 BONE AND IVORY OBJECTS [CH. 32

GROUP F. MISCELLANEOUS
CLASS XX. (Nos. 119—28)

1 19. Proﬁle head of ram in low relief, of fossilised ivory. Length 1 in. The relief is admirably
carved. It is ﬂat at the back and may have been aﬂixed to a knife—handle or pin-head. Among
the Romans a ram’s head was an auspicious symbol of hospitality (cf. Dar. et Sag. 3.7).
‘Hospitum’). For another ram’s head carved on a scaraboid seal, see ‘Seals and Sealings’,
ch. 34, no. 11. Both objects come from the Bhir Mound and are referable to the same period.
For the ram motif in other objects, see ‘Copper and Bronze’, ch. 28, nos. 298, 299; ‘Seals’,
ch. 34, no. 10; ‘Beads’, ch. 37, pp. 737 and 749. The fossilised ivory of which this and no. 122
are made probably came from Siberia, whence the Mughals also obtained their supply of it.
Bm. ’20-596; sq. 34-27’; stratum II. (Pl. 208, no. 52.)

120. Ivory handle or pendantvadorned on either side with a bearded Greek head of the
philosopher type, seemingly of Socrates. The carving is good Hellenistic work. Through the
middle of the pendant is a vertical hole and, at the back of the heads, two diagonal channels,
presumably for metal bands. The two heads are much worn, and this, coupled with the large

size of the hole, suggests that the object served as a handle rather than as a pendant. Width .

Greek level beneath forecourt of stﬁpa-chapel in Block D. Cf. p. 151 supra. (Pl. 203, p.)
