CH. 32] BONE AND IVORY OBJECTS 661

rough bone arrow-heads described below (nos. IO 5—7), but a tiny ball at the point
leaves no doubt that, even if it was intended for an arrow—head in the ﬁrst instance,
it was converted into a stilus or modelling tool afterwards. The other (no. 70) is
the usual kind of stilus with plain point and rounded butt, but somewhat heavier
than the Sirkap examples. It should be added that the ball-pointed specimens
may have served as modelling tools.I An example of a modelling tool furnished
with such a ball point at one end is ﬁgured among some ancient Roman speci-
mens from Arezzo in Blﬁmner, Technologie, II, p. 110 and Schreiber, Atlas of
Classical Antiquities, Pl. LXVIII, II.

69. Stilus(?) of bone, resembling a rough arrow-head of Class XVIII, but with ball
point. Length 25 in. Bm. ’21—205; sq. 22-60’; stratum III.

70. Bone stilus, with plain point and rounded butt. Length 5-75 in. Bm. ’20—716; sq. 3 5-28’;
stratum II. For examples of classical stili with rounded or knob butts, cf. Schreiber, op. cit.
Pl. x01, 3, 5, 7. (P1. 206, no. 30.)

71. Bone stilus, with plain point and ﬂattened butt. Length 4 in. Sk. ’26—2,788; Block F;
Sq. 89-50'; stratum III. For examples of classical stili with ﬂattened butts, cf. Schreiber,
op. cit. Pls. X0, 5 and X01, 6. Cf. p. 166 supra. (Pl. 206, no. 31.)

72. Similar, but with rounded butt. Length 4.5 in. Sk. ’26—1,108; Block I; sq. 135-49’;
stratum III.

73. Similar to no. 71. Length 393 in. Sk. ’24—149; Block C; sq. 45-40’; stratum II.
Cf. p. 149, n. 2 supra. (Pl. 206, no. 33.)

74. Similar, but with tenon at head. Length 325 in. Sk. ’15—933; Block K’; sq. 168'99’;
stratum II. The tenon was presumably intended for ﬁxing an ornamental terminal such as
that ﬁgured in Schreiber, op. cit. Pl. LXXXIX, 5. Cf. p. 180 supra.

75. Similar, but with rounded butt, roughly cut. Length 449 in. Sk. ’26—I,437; Block J;
sq. 145-47’; stratum II. Cf. p. 171 supra. (Pl. 206, no. 34.)

76. Bone stilus (?) with ball point and ﬂattened butt. Length 4' 5 in. This and the following
specimens may have served as modelling tools rather than writing stili. See above. Sk. ’24——502;
Block C; sq. 41-53'; stratum III. Cf. p. 149, n. 2 supra. (Pl. 206, no. 36.)

77. Similar, with ball point broken. Butt slightly ﬂattened. Length 56 in. Sk. ’I3—I,345;
Block E; sq. 72-57’; stratum II. Cf. p. 162, n. 1 supra. ,

78. Similar, with ball point and ﬂattened butt. Length 431 in. Sk. ’26—2,009; Block I;
sq. 129-40’; stratum II. Cf. p. 171 supra. (Pl. 206, no. 35.)

79. Similar to preceding, but of ivory. Length 4 in. Sk. ’15—395; Block H; sq. 118-49’;
stratum II. Cf. p. 170 supra.

80. Similar, but of bone. Length 318 in. Sk. ’15—248; Block H; sq. 116-43’; stratum II.
Cf. p. 170 supra.

81. Similar, but with longer shaft, broken and rounded off, and well-made chisel-shaped
butt. Length 612 in. Sk. ’28—217; Block A’; sq. 15'92'; stratum IV. Cf. p. 135 supra.
(Pl. 200, m and P1. 206, no. 38.)

CLASS XIII. Spindle-whorls (nos. 82—4)

Very few specimens of spindle-whorls made from bone or ivory have been found
at Taxila, and all of them come from Bhir Mound strata of the fourth to third
centuries 3.0.

1 It is noteworthy in this connexion that the Greek word ypoccpls is used for both a stile and a
graver.
