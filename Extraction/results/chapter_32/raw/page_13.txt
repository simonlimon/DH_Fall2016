GROUP E. WEAPONS AND HORSE—BRIDLES

CLASS XVIII. Arrow-heads (nos. 105—14)

The bone and ivory arrow—heads from Taxila are of four types, viz. : (a) roughly
shaped and sharpened at both ends. These are the objects which Cunningham took
to be ‘ spillikins ’ or ‘ tip-cats ’, but they are much too small for the game in question
and there can no longer be any doubt that they served as arrow-heads; (b) with
smooth circular point and well-deﬁned tang; (c) with a point similar to (b) but with
a hollow socket—hole behind for the shaft—tenon; (d) with a trilateral point and
hollow socket—hole behind. Type (a) is found in both the Bhir Mound and Sirkap
and was in use from the ﬁfth or sixth century B.C. to the ﬁrst century A.D.; but
the earlier Bhir Mound specimens are distinguished from the Sirkap ones by
having the point of the arrow-head somewhat better ﬁnished than the tang.
Types ([2), (c) and (d) are found exclusively in the Bhir Mound and date from the
fourth and third centuries B.C.

Kautilya (bk. II, ch. 18) mentions arrows tipped with bone or wood as well as
with metal, but these bone and ivory arrow-heads from Taxila could hardly have
been intended for serious warfare, unless they were poisoned. Possibly they were
employed for practice archeryI or for shooting birds; or it may be that they were
found useful for the town police as being less deadly than iron ones.

The following are typical specimens:

Type a. Roughly shaped and sharpened at both ends.

105. Bone arrow-head with sharp point and tapering tang. Length 3-18 in. Bm. ’19—1,995;
sq. 10'38’; stratum IV. (Pl. 206, no. 9.)

106. Similar. Length 25 in. Bin. ’21—254; sq. 27-60’; stratum IV. (P1. 206, no. 6.)
