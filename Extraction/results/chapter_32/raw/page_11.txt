GROUP D. GAMESMEN AND PLAYTHINGS

These comprise: (a) ﬂat tablets, circular, square, or hexagonal in shape, which
probably served as draughtsmen or counters; (b) playing dice of the long Indian
type; and (c) knuckle-bones for playing the Greek game of astragaloi.

C L A S s XIV. Draughtsmen or counters (nos. 8 5—9 1)

These come exclusively from the Bhir Mound and are referable to the ﬁfth to
third centuries 3.0. They are made of both bone and ivory, and usually take the
form of ﬂat circular disks, ﬂat on the lower side and with a raised boss in the centre
of the upper side, surrounded by concentric circles or two concentric rows of
slightly raised excrescences. Others are thin, square, or hexagonal tablets. The
circular ones vary in diameter from 0-7 to 1-15 in. and in thickness from 0-8 to
0-18 in. The upper surface is highly polished.

85. Disk of ivory, with two concentric rows of circular excrescences round centre—«four
in inner row, eight in outer. Probably used as a draughtsman or counter. Diam. 0-68 in.
Bm. ’21—909; sq. 19-56’; stratum IV. (Pl. 200, i.)

86. Similar, with nine concentric rings round embossed centre. Diam. 1 in. Bm. ’21—345;

Bm. ’21—722; sq. 47-60’; stratum III. (Pl. 200, j.)

91. Similar, but of bone, with arrow, nandipada and swastika symbols engraved on one side
—perhaps for luck. Size 0-62 x 0-68 in. Bm. ’20—1,596; sq. 29-36’; stratum III. (Pl. 203, u.)

CLASS XV. Dice (nos. 92—8)

With one doubtful exception from the Bhir Mound, all the playing dice found
at Taxila come from Sirkap and Sirsukh, and are referable to the Greek and Saka—
Parthian period and later. They are made of ivory, bone, slateI and terra-cotta;2
are invariably oblong in shape, not cubical; and range in size from 1-8 X 022 in.
to 378 X 065 in.3 The numbers I, 2, 3 and 4 are indicated by concentric circles
or simple dots and as a rule follow each other consecutively round the four long

3 The smallest specimen comes from Sirsukh and is probably of late date.
