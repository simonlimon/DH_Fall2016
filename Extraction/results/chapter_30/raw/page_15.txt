bangle being expanded. Diam. 22 5 in. First century A.D. Sk. ’19—93 3 /2; Block D’; sq. 59-1 14’;
stratum II. Cf. ‘Copper and Bronze’, no. 6, and for Roman examples, B.M. Cat. of jewellery,
nos. 2803, 2809. Cf. p. 188, no. 6 supra, and for other objects from same hoard, see no. 84 supra.

116—19. Four hollow gold bangles with expanded trumpet-shaped ends. Diam. 3-12 in.

Width 162 in. The hoop or body of the bracelet is of fretted sheet-gold with a running acanthus
pattern relieved with comma-shaped leaves, circular box-settings and knots, the whole enclosed
in plaited—chain borders. The leaves are inlaid with white orthoclase felspar with convex
surface, and the circular settings with amber. The design on the gate clasps takes the form of
