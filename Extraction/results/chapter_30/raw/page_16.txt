CH. 30] GOLD AND SILVER JEWELLERY ' 635

This type of clasped bracelet goes back to the fourth or ﬁfth century B.C. in the Near East,
but appears to have been Scytho-Greek rather than Greek. For a ﬁne specimen of the fourth
century B.C., found in a royal tomb at Koul-Oba in the Crimea and closely resembling this
bracelet from Taxila, cf. Dar. et Sag. s.v. ‘Armilla’, I, p. 436, ﬁg. 529, and Antiquite’s du
Bosphore cimmérien (Russian Government Publication, St Petersburg, 1854, Paris, 1892),
P1. XIV, 4. For other objects from the same hoard, see no. 2 supra. (Pl. 196, a.)

I 39. Gold bracelet similar to preceding. Diam. 24 in.; width 175 in. The hoop is
decorated with leaf design, knots and oval box-settings, inlaid with carbuncles—the whole
surrounded by a beaded border. There were traces of turquoise or turquoise paste in the leaf
cloisons when ﬁrst discovered. The design of the square gate-clasp is the same as in nos. I37
and 138, but the gems in the circular settings are different. The gems from the corner crescent
and circle cloisons are missing. The hinge and fastening of the clasp are of plain instead of
beaded tubing. First century A.D. Sk. ’17—A1, a. From ﬁeld near Sirkap. (Pl. 196, b.)

140, 141. Pair of gold bracelets of similar type to the preceding. Diam. 2-5 in.; width
187 in. The decoration on the hoop consists of four rows of S—shaped ﬁgures alternately
reversed so as to form an ivy-leaf pattern. Enclosing it is a plaited-chain border. The clasp is
solid and enriched with leaf-shaped cloisons once ﬁlled with gems or paste and with an oval
box—setting in the centre. In one setting the inlay is rock-crystal en cabochon. In the other it is
glass paste, now much decayed. The border is the same as that round the hoop. For the S—shaped
fretted pattern, cf. B.M. Cat. of jewellery, no. 2735 (P1. LIX) of the ﬁrst to second century from
Egypt. The ivy pattern is common at all periods in Greek and Graeco-Roman jewellery. First
century A.D. Sk. ’29—2,193/1; Block G’; sq. 108-87’; stratum II.‘ Cf. p. 180 supra; A.S.R. (1929),
p. 67, no. 75 and Pl. XVIII, 5. For other objects from same hoard, see no. 25 supra. (Pl. 196, c, e.)

142, I43. Pair of gold bracelets of similar pattern to the preceding but narrower. Diam.
1-81 in. The design in the hoop consists of a double S repeat fretted from sheet-gold, enclosed
in a beaded border. The leaf cloisons on the clasp are ﬁlled with orthoclase felspar; the gem
from the central setting is missing. There is no gold backing to the clasp, as in nos. 140, 141.
First century A.D. Sk. ’29—1,24I/5; Block D’; sq. 62'113’; stratum III. Cf. p. 187, no. I7
supra; A.S.R. (1929), p. 60, no. 5 and P1. XVIII, 4. For other objects from same hoard, see
nos. 7, 8 above. (Pl. 196, d.)

CLASS VIII. Torques (nos. 144—7)

The torque, which was as foreign to India as it was to Greece and Italy, was
a characteristic ornament among the Scythic and Celtic peoples, and was worn as
a mark of distinction by the Medes, Persians and Parthians, all of whom were of
the same Iranian stock as the Scythians. (Cf. Dar. et Sag. s12. ‘Torques’;
Wroth, Cat. of the Coins of Parthia, passim; and for deities offering this token, see
ch. 38, p. 771 and n. 2.) The specimens found at Taxila were doubtless the
property of people of Saka or Parthian nationality.

I44. Hollow gold torque of beaten sheet-gold on a core of lac, with trumpet-shaped ends in
front. Diam. 5-75 in. It is composed of two semicircles united at the narrow ends by a tenon-
and-socket hinge and provided with a push-fastener at the expanded ends, very much like the
modern patent ‘push’ fastener. Sk. ’29—1, 362/ I ; Block D’; sq. 62-1 13’; stratum IV. From same
hoard as no. 46 supra ((1.1).). Cf. p. 188, no. 1 supra; A.S.R. (1929), p. 62, no. 43. (Pl. 195, k.)

145. Gold torque of similar design and make to the preceding. Diam. 5-75 in. First century
A.D. Sk. ’29—2,193/2; Block G’; sq. 108-87’; stratum II. Cf. p. 180 supra; A.S.R. (1929),
p. 67, no. 76. For other objects from same hoard, see no. 25 supra.

I46. Torque of beaten gold on core of lac(?). Diam. 587 in. It is made in one piece with
expanded ends, the thickness of the tube increasing gradually from back to front. The ends are
