the outside and ﬁve projecting knobs at the top. Length 031 in. The beading is stamped, not
granulated, and soldered to the strips of plain gold between. This ornament appears to be an
ear—ring of the a baule type, which was fashionable in Etruria, where it was probably intro-
duced from the East in the sixth and ﬁfth centuries B.C. Whether the type survived to a later
date in the Near East is not known. The single specimen from Taxila was found on the Bhir

sq. 32-26’; stratum III. Cf. A.S.R. (1924), p. 48; BM. Cat. of jewellery, p. xxvii and nos.
