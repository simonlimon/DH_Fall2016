of these necklaces (nos. 54, 5 5) come from the city on the Bhir Mound and are assign-
able to the close of the fourth century B.C.; the rest date from the ﬁrst century A.D.

54. Necklace of thirty spherical beads with seventeen spacer circlets. Diam. of beads,
0-31—0-37 in. The beads, of impure gold, are gadrooned and collared; the spacers, of pure gold,
are embellished with bands of drops and granules in varying patterns. The collars of the beads
are made separately and soldered on. From same hoard as no. 52 (q.v.). Cf. A.S.R. (1924),
p. 48, l. 19. (Pl. 192, a.)

55. Silver necklace of thirty—seven pendants. Height 0-68 in. The pendants are hollow and
consist of a hemispherical drop with a T-shaped top. The top is decorated with incised lines
and pierced laterally with two holes. The back and front are made separately and soldered.
From same hoard as preceding. (Pl. 192, c.)

56. Gold necklace of twenty-three pendants with twenty spacer beads and two terminals.
Height of pendants 1-87 in. The pendants are of two patterns, alternating with one another.
One pattern consists of an oval crystal en cabochon in a beaded setting enclosed by two dolphins
affrontés, from the tails of which hang three chains ending in ﬂat disks. At the top is a spherical
knob with ﬁnely granulated surface, pierced laterally for suspension. The ﬁshes are of thin
repousse’ gold with backs soldered on; the neck above is made in a separate piece. The other
pattern consists of a quatrefoil device of seven cloisons inlaid with ﬂat pieces of white orthoclase
felspar, with three chains and disks hanging from the base and a knob of plain instead of
granulated gold at the top. The spacing beads are of openwork metal, composed of twelve
circlets inlaid with white orthoclase felspar and strengthened with studs of gold granules. The
two terminals take the form of ‘ox-heads’ inlaid with orthoclase felspar and black agate and
outlined with a granulated beading. The necklace was strung on two strings, one passing
through the beads at the top of the pendants, the other through a series of small horizontal
tubes soldered on to their backs. At the back of the terminals are two tubes to take the strings.
For the double dolphin motif, cf. no. 1 above and references there cited, and for the openwork
beads, no. 59 below and RM. Cat. of jewellery, Pl. LIII, no. 2567. First century A.D. Sk. ’29—
1,241/7 and 10; Block D’; sq. 62-113’; stratum III. Cf. p. 187, no. 6supra; A.S.R. (1929), p. 60,

57. Gold necklace of thirty-one pieces, including two terminals. Height of pendants,
1-19 in. The pendants are of two patterns, alternating. One pattern consists of a small circlet of
gold centred with a carbuncle and edged round with a double granulated beading; at the base
is an openwork obcordate attachment enclosing a triple cluster of granules, and above it
a spherical bead covered with ﬁne granulation and pierced laterally for a string. The other
pattern is of quatrefoil form made up of seven cloisons inlaid with white orthoclase felspar; the
obcordate attachment below encloses a tiny heart-shaped cloison inlaid with white orthoclase
felspar instead of granule clusters, while the bead at the top is plain instead of granulated. The
terminals, which are composed of nine cloisons, are inlaid with white orthoclase felspar and
lapis-lazuli. The necklace was strung in the same way as no. 56. First century A.D. Sk. ’29—
1,507; Block D’; sq. 6492’. Cf. p. 186, Deposit A, no. 2 supra; A.S.R. (1929), p. 65, no. 53

58. Gold necklace of twenty-seven pendants including two terminals. Height of pendants
1-06 in. The design resembles that of no. 57, but half the pendants were inlaid with rock
crystal en cabochon instead of carbuncles, and the others with blue turquoise paste in the centre
and top cloisons and white orthoclase felspar in the four leaves. There are triple clusters of
granules also in all the obcordate attachments at the base of the pendants and small spacing
beads on the upper string. First century A.D. Sk. ’24—683/2; sq. 3 1-47’; stratum II. From same
hoard as nos. 13, 14 (go). Cf. p. 147, no. 2 supra; A.S.R. (1924), p. 49, no. 2 and P1. XI, 2.
