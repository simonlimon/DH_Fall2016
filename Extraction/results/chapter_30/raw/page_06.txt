CH. 30] GOLD AND SILVER JEWELLERY 625

rosette, two hearts and a narrow strap. The rosette and hearts were inlaid with stones or pastes
which are now missing. The pendent buds are covered with ﬁne granulation and their ﬁve points
end in clusters of drops and granules. The ring to which the bud is attached is decorated on the
outside with a double row of beads divided one from the other by a ﬁne beading. At the top
of the leech crescent is a small ring by which the ornament was suspended from the ear. First
century A.D. Sk. ’13—194/5—6; sq. 7766’; Block E; stratum II. Cf. A.S.R. (1912), p. 26,

of ﬁlling hollow ornaments of gold-foil with solid substances Such as pitch, wax, mastic, etc.,
is alluded to in the temple inventories of Delos, where we read, for example, of uﬁho: xpuoé’:
