CH. 30] GOLD AND SILVER JEWELLERY 633

CLASS VI. Hair-pins (nos. 100, 101)

100. Gold hair-pin With ﬂat ‘Wheel’ head decorated on both sides with cinquefoil rosette
inlaid with white orthoclase felspar and encircled by double beading. Length 437 in. First
century A.D. Sk. ’29—1,24I/2o; Block D’; sq. 62-113’; stratum III. Cf. p. 187, no. 14 supra;
A.S.R. (1929), p. 61, no. 19 and P1. XIX, 14; and for other objects from same hoard, see
nos. 7, 8 supra.’ (Pl. 191, z.)

101. Hair—pin of .silver with gold head. Length 565 in. The head consists of a crescent
resting on a small cube and surmounted by a triratna device. Four pearl drops on gold Wire
hang from the crescent and two from the triratna. Three circlets of gold with double rows of
beading support each of the three component parts. A particular interest attaches to this
hair—pin because of the combination of Indian and Greek motifs, the crescent (Gr. uﬁvw'Kos)
being characteristically Greek (e.g. B.M. Cat. of jewellery, nos. 2360—5, 2449—62, etc.) and the
triratna just as characteristically Indian. A similar pin but without the crescent is ﬁgured on
the west gateway of Saﬁchi fastening the knotted thong over the scabbard of a broad sword
(Marshall and Foucher, The Monuments of Sanchz‘, Pl. LXVI, a). The triratna, an age-old device
in India, was specially adopted by the Buddhists as a symbol of the Buddhist Trinity, and is
ﬁgured in great profusion on the early Buddhist monuments at Saﬁchi, Bharhat and elsewhere.
It also occurs as a monogram on the coins of contemporary Indo—Parthian and Kushﬁn kings.
First century A.D. Sk. ’26—4,o81 /1; Block D; sq. 58-47’; stratum III. Cf. p. 156, no. IO
