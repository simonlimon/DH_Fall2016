differences in the ﬁnishing of the hair and other details. The facial type represented by these
heads, with its rather short nose, full cheeks and chin, and pronouncedly curved lips, is
characteristic of many of the stucco sculptures found at Kalawan, as well as of one or two from
the Dharmarajika Stﬁpa, but not represented at other sites.

86, a=Kn. ’31—86. Found to the north of A4; 3 ft. 6 in. below surface. Height 5- 5 in. Nose
and left eye and cheek damaged.

86, b=Kn. ’31—234. From east of A4; 5 ft. below surface. Height 6 in. Tip of nose and
right ear—lobe damaged. (Pl. 160, i.)

86, c: Kn. ’31—464. From south of A4; 4 ft. 6 in. below surface. Height 5-6 in. (P1. 161, a.)

dhotz', shawl, necklace andrneckband. Head and legs below knees missing. Height 14in. In
his left hand he holds an uncertain object, probably a ﬂask; if so, the Bodhisattva portrayed

tend to be slightly cumbersome. (Pl. 161, e.)

3- 5 in. The hair, which falls over the forehead, is ﬁnished with a fringe of curls or braided
