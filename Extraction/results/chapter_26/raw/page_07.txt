CH. 26] STUCCO SCULPTURES 523

affords a good opportunity of examining the technique of these ﬁgures. Over the plaster is a
ﬁne slip of lime or more probably ﬁne ‘shell’ plaster, applied before the ﬁnal deﬁnition was
given to the features. The paste must have been still soft when the slip was put on, and it
was not until after the application of the latter that the ﬁne lines were impressed with a
modelling tool around the nostrils, etc. The face is left white, but the lips, edges of nostrils,
rims and folds of eyelids, edges of hair, folds of neck and ear—lobes, are picked out in red, and
the hair is coloured grey-black. Observe the long and narrow eyes, slanting upwards at the
outer corners, the small and sensitive nostrils, the full lips and prolonged ear-lobes. Cf. p. 362 (4.)

STUcco RELIEFS 0F IAULIASI. Nos. 39—71. (Cf. ch. 20, pp. 371—84.)

For variety and extent the collection of stucco ﬁgures found at the saughdrdma
of Iauliaﬁ is by far the most important at Taxila. It does not contain anything up
to the standard of the ﬁnest reliefs at Mohra Moradu, but, on the other hand, it
comprises countless examples of every kind of ﬁgurine employed in the ﬁfth
century to adorn the smaller class of stﬁpas. In describing these stucco sculptures
of Jauliaﬁ we shall start with the large and medium-sized images found in situ,
then proceed to the smaller ﬁgurines also in situ, and close our account with the
detached heads and other disjecta membm which were lying among the fallen
debris.

A. Large and medium-sized sculptures in situ. Nos. 39—42. These are found
either in the image-shrines (e.g. no. 39 infra) or decorating the bases of stﬁpas
(e.g. nos. 40, 41 and 42) or in niches let into the monastery walls or on pedestals
in front of some of the cells. On the base of the main stﬁpa the images are, as
usual, divided one from the other by pilasters; on the smaller stﬁpas the pilasters
are sometimes absent.

39. In. ’27—F 585. A ﬁne group of stucco ﬁgures found in chapel EI at Iauliaﬁ, and now in
the museum. In the centre is seated the Buddha in the attitude of Meditation (dhydna-mudrd)
with a standing Buddha to his right and left and two attendant ﬁgures behind. Of the latter,
the one to his right is carrying the ﬂy—whisk (caurz'); the other, as suggested by his head-dress,
is Indra, holding the thunderbolt (vajm) in his left hand. On the central image are still many

traces of the red and black paint and of the gold-leaf with which it, and doubtless the other
