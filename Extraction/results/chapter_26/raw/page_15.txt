CH. 26] STUCCO SCULPTURES 531

92. Kn. ’31—442. From west of A 4; 4 ft. below surface. Height 5-3 in. Head of a lay-
worshipper with ear-pendants and ﬁllet over the hair. Below ﬁllet, in front, is a crescent, and
above it, a small peak. Tip of nose and right side of hair damaged. (Pl. 161, g.)

93. Kn. ’31—507. From east of A12; 3 ft. below surface. Height 3-6 in. Head of ascetic(?)
with hair coiled on crown of head, moustache and beard. The eyes are large and prominent
and the lips full. Traces of a yellowish slip and of red paint are observable on the beard,
moustache and cheek. There is a breadth and freedom in the modelling of this head which
distinguishes a number of the Kalawan sculptures, notably nos. 86, 87, 91. (Pl. 161, i.)

94. Kn. ’31—440. From west of A 4; 4—7 ft. below surface. Head of ascetic with long hair
drawn back over ears, ushm‘sha—like topknot and ﬁllet over brows. Height 5-6 in. Wears
pendants, moustache and beard. Tip of nose and front of ﬁllet damaged. If this is a Brahmanical
ascetic, it is not clear why he should have a ﬁllet and ear-rings. Observe the same wide-open
eyes and full lips as in the previous example. (Pl. 161, h.)

95. Kn. ’31—446. From west of A 4; 4 ft. below surface. Head of grotesque atlant ﬁgure or
of one of the warriors from Mara’s army. Height 3-25 in. Observe the protruding teeth and
prominent eyeballs and rough matted hair, standing on end. Tuft of hair at each end of the
lips. Traces of red paint on hair. Chin damaged. (Pl. 161, j.)

96. Kn. ’31—300. From west of A4; 2 ft. below surface. Height 10 in. Part of body and

legs of a warrior, wearing a dhoti and coat of mail. Probably a warrior from Mara’s army.
(Pl. 161, k.)

STUCCO FIGURES OF GIRI
Nos. 97, 98. (Cf. ch. 15, p. 345.)

97. Gr. ’27—329. From near the southern outer wall. 6 ft. 2 in. below surface. Head of the
Buddha with chrome yellow slip over the face. Height 7-75 in. Traces of black paint on the
brows and of red on lips. Left side of head damaged and ushm'sha missing. A very conventional
type, of little distinction. (Pl. 161, l.)

98. Gr. ’27—321. From main stﬁpa, panel 5; 4 ft. 4 in. below surface. Head of a Bodhisattva
with ornamental head-dress bunched into a topknot on the crown. Height 9 in. Left ear and
tip of nose damaged. (Pl. 161, n.)

STUcco FIGURES or BHAMALA
Nos. 99—102. (Cf. ch. 22, pp. 392, 396.)

99. B1. ’29—340. Panel from the plinth on the south-east side of the main stﬁpa, 28 x 18 in.
It depicts the Buddha’s mahdparinirvdna. Between two Corinthian pilasters the Buddha is
lying at full-length on his right side. Behind him are four mourning ﬁgures, of whom the one
near his feet seems to be a woman. Below, on the face of the plinth, are four other small ﬁgures,
of which the one near the head is a Dhyani Buddha, and the one near the feet a devotee kneeling
with folded hands. The two central ﬁgures appear to have swooned with grief at the sight of
their dying Master. This is the only stucco panel from this part of India which depicts the
Buddha’s death-scene. (P13. 118, b; 161, m; the latter showing the relief as set up in the
museum.)

100. B1. ’29—56. From debris on the east steps. 3 ft. below surface. Head of a lay—
worshipper(?) of exceptionally good workmanship. Height 5-5 in. But observe the inordinate
height of the forehead and the relative smallness of the eyes, nose and mouth. The modelling
is free and plastic, the technique being that of terra-cotta rather than stucco. This is very
noticeable in the curls of the hair, which are made separately and stuck on, as they commonly
are in terra-cotta heads. (Pl. 161, o.)
