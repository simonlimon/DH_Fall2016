CH. 26] srucco SCULPTURES 527

apply also to no. 54, only that in this type the face is broader, the cheeks fuller and
the eyelids heavier. In no. 55, again, we have a more unconventional cast of
countenance, with dull, ﬂeshy features in which no spark of inspiration or beauty
is visible.

52. In. ’16—1 19. West of main stﬁpa. Stucco head of the Buddha. Height 7-12 in. Buff
slip. Traces of red and black paint. This head has been struck from the same mould as the two
heads illustrated in my Memoir on the Stﬂpas and Monastery at jaulia'ﬁ, P1. XIX, d, e, but it is
noteworthy that the hair in each case is differently treated, showing that it was modelled by
hand; and there are other small differences as well, due to retouching. The cast of features
distinctive of these heads has already been remarked on. (Pl. 158, a.)

53. In. ’16—168, a. Main stﬁpa-court. Stucco head of Buddha. Height 8-5 in. Right eye-
brow and ﬁrm? damaged. Lime—wash. The eyebrows are highly arched; the eyelids more than
half—closed and doubly ﬂexured but not oblique; the mouth small and lacking in character.
The modelling of all these features and of the cheeks and nose, is reﬁned and delicate. On the
other hand, the hair is treated in a very perfunctory manner and evidently relied upon colour
to help out its deﬁnition. in. Mem. p. 43, no. 14. (Pl. 158, b.) 7 .

54. In. ’I6—F 12. Main stﬁpa—court. Stucco head of the Buddha. Height 7 in. Ears slightly
damaged. The hair in this example is treated more effectively than in the preceding, but is still
somewhat crude. On the other hand, the deﬁnition of eyebrows, eyelids and mouth is not so
delicate and there is little mobility in the modelling of the cheeks. j’n. Mem. Pl. XIX, g.
(Pl. 1 58, d.)

55. In. ’16—192, b. From between stﬁpas A11 and A12. Upper part of Buddha ﬁgure in
the s’z'kshd-mudrd; with saﬁghdﬁ over both shoulders. Height 9-37 in. The features are full and
ﬂeshy and devoid of all spirituality. The hair is disposed in ringlets, which are perfunctorily
indicated by small, round depressions. The hands are well modelled and natural. Traces of red
paint on hands, lips, ears, eyes, forehead and saﬁghdﬁ. The left ear is damaged. 3%. Mem.
P1. XIX, 6. (Pl. 158, c.)

56. In. ’16—10. Main stﬁpa—court. Stucco head of a Bodhisattva. Height 7 in. Right ear
missing. Hair conﬁned within a ﬁllet and waved from forehead over the ears. ,Wears kuztdala
in left ear. This is a particularly ﬁne head with classic but not over-conventionalised features;
at once digniﬁed and reposeful. in Mem. Pl. XXI, s and p. 47, no. 71. (Pl. 158», e.)

57. In. ’16—56. Between chapels CI and DI. Upper part of Bodhisattva ﬁgure, with
damaged halo and head-dress. Height 6-75 in. He wears an elaborate head-dress and
numerous ornaments, including ear—rings, torque and necklace. The hair is bound by a taem'a
with rosettes in front and to either side; above, ends of ribbon bow. A ﬁne decorative piece,
recalling to mind some Roman imperial ﬁgure. Unfortunately, the surface of the stucco is
very rough, and its appearance much impaired thereby. 3‘71. Mem. Pl. XX, a and p. 44, no. 29.
(Pl. I 58, h.)

58. In. ’16—103, 6. West of stﬁpa D4. Upper portion of a female devotee, with face turned
to her right. Height 6 in. Hair in corkscrew curls conﬁned by ﬁllet, with fan—tailed head—dress
on top. Wears ear-rings and bracelets. Is offering ﬂowers from a fold in her shawl. Observe
that the features are slightly lop-sided, owing to the face having been turned partly towards
the wall—a defect seen in a great many of these ﬁgural reliefs from the sides of stﬁpas, e.g.
nos. 60, 61, 66 infra. j‘n. Mem. P1. XX, d and p. 44, no. 32. (P1. 158, g.)

59. In. ’16—545. Female ﬁgure, with head and legs missing. Height 7-37 in. Wears sleeved
tunic and scarf, a necklace with pendant in front and bangles on her wrists. The tunic is fastened
with a band above the waist, and falls over it much like the Greek kolpos. On scarf and tunic
are traces of red paint. The ﬁgure is well and vigorously modelled and affords a good illustration
of the dress of the period. 3%. Mem. P1. XXII, a, and p. 47, no. 79. (Pl. 158, k.)
