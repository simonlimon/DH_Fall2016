518 STUCCO SCULPTURES [CH. 26

their nearest parallel among cult statues of the Greek pantheon. Unfortunately, the upper part
of the head is mutilated, but what remains is quite enough to show that the sculptor had an
intimate knowledge of Hellenistic art. Cf. A.S.R. (1912), P1. XVIII, c.

CLASS II. Sculptures in bastard Hellenistic style (nos. 3—18)

These are the sculptures executed by local craftsmen in more or less imitation
of Greek or Graeco-Roman models. Some of them resemble the small terra-cotta
ﬁgurines of this period found at Akra and other contemporary sites, including
Sirkap itself. (‘ Terra—cottas’, ch. 24, nos. 46—9; Pl. I 33.) On the top of the head
there is commonly a topknot encircled with a bandeau or wreath, which is often
much too small for the size of the head.I In front, the hair either falls over the
forehead in short strands or is rolled back over the ears. Sometimes it is plaited or
braided or curled along the front edge, as in archaic Greek statues.

The sculptures of this class fall into the following ﬁve subdivisions, the charac-
teristics of which appear to be mainly due to the idiosyncrasies of the sculptors.

Type a. With nose of normal size, short upper lip and small, rather insigniﬁcant
mouth. The eyes are carelessly modelled.

3. Sk. ’I3—2,088; sq. 54-62’; stratum II. Height 6 in. Female headwith heavy laurel wreath.
Hair parted from centre and rolled back over the ears, with two rosettes over the left ear. Right
side of forehead and part of nose damaged; topknot missing. Lime-wash. (Pl. 148, no. 3.)

4. Sk. ’I3~2,118; sq. 54-61’; stratum II. Height 5 in. Female head. Hair parted in centre
and rolled back over ears; the topknot being, bound round with a twisted kerchief. Ear—
pendant missing on left side. (Pl. 148, no. 4.)

5. Sk. ’I3—2,Io7; sq. 54-62’; stratum II. Height 6-37 in. Female head. Hair arranged in
corkscrew curls falling like a Wig over forehead and ears, and surmounted by a high topknot
tied at the base with a bandeau. Small ear-pendants. (Pl. 148, no. 5.)

6. Belonging to the same class as the above but in sharp contrast with them, by reason of the
different treatment of the eyes, is the head Sk. ’12; Trench A 481; stratum II (height 4~12 in.).
In this case the eyes are wide open and staring, with highly arched eyebrows, while the hair is
arranged in ringlets with a topknot above, as it was on heads of the Buddha. For the wide-open,
staring eyes, cf. ch. 25, no. 63, and ch. 36, pp. 693—4. (Pl. 148, no. 6.)

Type b. With nose of normal size, full lips, and short upper hp.

7. Sk. ’I3—2,02.I; sq. 63-62’; stratum II. Height 4-2 in. Female head, with rather short hair
combed from the crown over the forehead, and with a topknot which was once encircled with
a Wreath. Rosette over right ear. Long cylindrical pendants in ears (preserved in left ear
only). (Pl. 148, no. 7.)

8. Sk. ’I3—2,008; sq. 63°62’; stratum II. Height 4-5 in. Female (?) head, with highly arched
brows and slightly smiling lips. Wears heavy ear-pendants; hair combed on to forehead and
plaited or braided at the fringe. Above, smooth plain wreath, which may have been painted.
Cf. A.S.R. (1912), P1. XVIII, 5. (Pl. 148, no. 8.)

9. Sk. ’I 3~2,oo6; sq. 63-62’; stratum II. Height 47 5 in. Female head. The eyes are carelessly
modelled and the shape of the face is irregular, as if intended to be seen from one side only,
like many of the later stuccos. The hair falls thickly from the crown over forehead and ears;

I It seems not unlikely that the ushnisha of the Buddha image evolved in Gandhira had its origin in
these topknots.
