52o STUCCO SCULPTURES [CH. 26

21. Sk. ’12—247; sq. 63-65’; stratum I. Height 4 in. Similar to preceding, but with large
open eyes. Ear-rings in both ears. (Pl. I49, d.)

22. Sk. ’13—2,158; sq. 54.60’; stratum II. Height 5-5 in. Similar, but without moustache.
The ears and part of right cheek are missing. Observe the circular indentation in the short

upper lip. (P1. 149, e.)
CLASS IV. Torsos and limbs (no. 23)

23. Few pieces of the torsos or limbs belonging to these heads have been preserved. The
biggest fragment is no. 23 (= Sk. ’13—2,125; sq. 54-61’; stratum II; height 8 in.). It belongs to
the ﬁgure of a well-developed woman, with her left arm bent double and leaning on a cushion.
The head and lower part of the body are missing, as well as the left shoulder and left hand.
The modelling is vigorous, but coarse and clumsy, with little feeling for plasticity.

CLASS V. Architectural fragments (nos. 24—9)

These comprise part of a lotus capital, no. 24 (= Sk. ’I3—2,Ioo; sq. 54-62’; stratum II; height
8 in.), with bead—and-reel moulding below the leaves, and fragments of various swags or garlands
used to decorate the sides of the stﬁpas. Of the latter, no. 25 (=Sk. ’12—815; sq. 65-64’;
stratum II; length 10 in.) is adorned with six-petalled ﬂowers overlapping one another;
another (no. 26: Sk. ’12—1,027; sq. 6666’; length 7' 5 in.), with ﬁve-petalled ﬂowers between
crossed hands; a third (no. 27= Sk. ’12—820; stratum II; length 7 in.), with clusters of grapes
and acanthus leaves; a fourth (no. 28=Sk. ’12—815; sq. 65-64'; stratum II; length IO in.),
with simple obcordate petals; and a ﬁfth (no. 29 = Sk. ’12—81 5; sq. 65-64’; stratum II; length
11-75 in.), with quatrefoil blossom in reticulated pattern. (Pl. 149, f, g, i, j.)

GROUP B. SCULPTURES OF THE INDO-AFGHKN SCHOOL
(FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES AD.)

The sculptures of the Indo-Afghan School, which are represented by the following
examples, fall into certain well—deﬁned categories. In the ﬁrst come the ﬁgures of
the Buddha, which, as we have already seen, retain, generally, the traditional
characteristics which distinguished them in the Gandhara School. In the second
are the Bodhisattvas, which are generally recognisable at a glance by their elaborate
head—dresses and the profusion of their jewellery. To the third category belong the
monks, who wear the same robes as their Master but, unlike him, have shaven
heads; and along with the monks a few specimens of Brahmanical ascetics. The
fourth category comprises a multitude of devas and lay-worshippers, both male and
female, who are represented making offerings or doing obeisance to the Blessed
One or to the Bodhisattvas. In the ﬁfth category is included an equally numerous
and varied company of yakshas or genii, which share, with the lions and elephants,
the burden of supporting the tiers of the stﬁpa-plinths. These atlantes, as we may
rightly call them, since the original conception of them was certainly derived from
Greek prototypes, are depicted with an endless variety of grotesque faces and in
every kind of writhing and tormented posture. The lions and elephants, as well as
the bulls which crown the Persepolitan pilasters, make up the sixth and last
category.
