I, from the apsidal temple D in Sirkap=Sk. ’13—2,o43; sq. 56-63’; stratum II. The head, of which the height is 8-12 in., is that of a typical Greek satyr, with pointed ears, broad ﬂat nose, moustache, beard and free-ﬂowing locks. There is nothing mechanical or crude about the workmanship. The features are modelled with feeling, and there is an intensity of expression in the knitted brows and half—parted lips and a boldness in the treatment of the hair and beard that bespeak a thorough mastery over the material, but at the same time a proper understanding of its i limitations. The strong, almost portrait-like individuality that characterises the countenance is typical of Greek art in its later phases; it is never found in early Indian art; nor is it a characteristic of the Gandhara School. With this and the following head the reader should compare the little head of Dionysus in silver repoussé ﬁgured in P1. 209, a, which is equally characteristic of Hellenistic craftsmanship. A.S.R.

(Pl. 149, f, g, i, j.) GROUP B. SCULPTURES OF THE INDO-AFGHKN SCHOOL (FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES AD.) The sculptures of the Indo-Afghan School, which are represented by the following examples, fall into certain well—deﬁned categories. In the ﬁrst come the ﬁgures of the Buddha, which, as we have already seen, retain, generally, the traditional characteristics which distinguished them in the Gandhara School. In the second are the Bodhisattvas, which are generally recognisable at a glance by their elaborate head—dresses and the profusion of their jewellery. To the third category belong the monks, who wear the same robes as their Master but, unlike him, have shaven heads; and along with the monks a few specimens of Brahmanical ascetics. The fourth category comprises a multitude of devas and lay-worshippers, both male and female, who are represented making offerings or doing obeisance to the Blessed One or to the Bodhisattvas. In the ﬁfth category is included an equally numerous and varied company of yakshas or genii, which share, with the lions and elephants, the burden of supporting the tiers of the stﬁpa-plinths. These atlantes, as we may rightly call them, since the original conception of them was certainly derived from Greek prototypes, are depicted with an endless variety of grotesque faces and in every kind of writhing and tormented posture. The lions and elephants, as well as the bulls which crown the Persepolitan pilasters, make up the sixth and last category. CH. 26] STUCCO SCULPTURES 521 STUCCO RELIEFS OF MOHBA MORADU. Nos. 30—8, a. (Cf. ch. 18, pp. 358—64.) A. Reliefs on the main stﬂpa. Among the most beautiful sculptures of the Indo- Afghan School, whether of stucco, clay or terra—cotta, are the reliefs already referred to, on the south face of the main stﬁpa at Mohra Moradu. This face was divided by slender pilasters into eight bays, each of which was subsequently adorned with a group of ﬁgures, comprising one or more images of the Buddha with attendant Bodhisattvas or devas, while the faces of the pilasters themselves were enriched with two seated ﬁgures of the Buddha, one above the other, some enthroned on lotuses, some on simple seats. Of these eight groups the most arresting is the one in the fourth bay from the western end, to which the premier place was evidently given in virtue of its being opposite, or virtually opposite, the central north-south axis of the stﬁpa drum. The group in this bay, nos. 30, 31 (Pls. I50, a, I 5 I), comprised a seated Buddha in the middle with a standing Bodhisattva on either side, two celestial beings (devas) coming out of the background, on each side of the Buddha’s head, and two other ﬁgures—probably Bodhisattvas—enthroned on lotuses in the top corners. The image of the Buddha in the centre is seated in the Teaching attitude (s’z'kshd—mudra') on a lion-throne (simha‘sana), in front of which are four miniature ﬁgures of lay-worshippers, including perhaps the donor of the group, two on one side of a bowl, two on the other. All the reliefs are coated with a thin slip of ﬁne plaster, and there are traces on them of the buff, red and black paints with which such ﬁgures seem to have been invariably embellished. The beauty of the group is necessarily much impaired by the damage it has sustained, especially to the head and hands of the central image, but the attendant Bodhisattvas and the deva above the left shoulder of the Buddha give us a splendid conception of what the Indo-Afghan School, at its best, was capable of achieving. In the whole range of Indian sculpture it would be difﬁcult to point to ﬁgures more beautifully conceived or more perfectly executed than these. Observe the Bodhisattva on the right (Pl. 151); how digniﬁed his posture, as he stands slightly inclining towards the central image; how calm his expression; how delicate the modelling of his features. And notice, too, with what consummate skill the sculptor has handled his garments, draping the dhoti ever so lightly and gracefully about his legs, turning the long scarf in stylish folds about his arms, and giving to the whole a delicate suggestion of movement, as if the Bodhisattva were being borne insensibly towards the Buddha. Then turn from this ﬁgure and observe the deva above, emerging out of the background. Nothing could be more tender than the attitude of his hands or more gentle than the expression on his face, as he descends from heaven to do homage to the Great Teacher. It is not only that these ﬁgures are nobly conceived; they are ﬁnished in every detail with exquisite grace and feeling. The draperies merit special notice. Although more formal and stylish than Hellenistic draperies, they exhibit the same technical methods as the latter in the treatment of their folds; that is to say, the mass of the material between the folds is cut away, and the folds themselves left standing out in relief, as they naturally 522 STUCCO SCULPTURES [CH. 26 do in any thin material. Roman sculptors, as is well known, made a practice of cutting away only the narrow folds and leaving the mass of the material between them unchiselled, thereby saving much labour but producing an effect which was not true to nature. Obviously it is much easier to adopt the Greek method when modelling in plaster or clay than when chiselling stone or marble, and, provided that a sculptor is conscientious in his work, it is the method to which, irrespective of tradition, he must inevitably be led, since it is the only one that is correct. But in the case of the Indo-Afghan School, there can be little room for doubt that in this, as in many other features, it inherited the Hellenistic tradition through the Gandhara School. That does not mean, of course, that this phase of art was merely a derivative or later reﬂexion of Gandhara art. It owed many of its motifs and ideas and much of its hieratic character to that art, but it went far beyond it, both in pure decorative beauty and in the expression of religious sentiment, and in these spheres it established new and far-reaching traditions which profoundly inﬂuenced the character of the Gupta and later medieval art of India. Compared with the foregoing, the reliefs in the other bays are of little interest. It might have been expected that the groups to the right and left would have been made to balance or at least to correspond in some measure with one another. But this was not the case. The bay on the left, i.e. the third in order from the south-west corner, contains the seated Buddha (no. 32: Pl. I 50, b) in the Teaching attitude, and on each side of him a Bodhisattva seated cross-legged on a lotus, while between them were smaller standing figuresI and other Bodhisattvas and devas above. The group is not unattractive, but it misses altogether the ﬁne feeling and masterly handling of the central one. The modelling of the Buddha is less sympathetic, his draperies coarser and more formal, and the two seated Bodhisattvas have none of the dignity and grace that belong to their standing counterparts in the other bay. Their drawing and modelling are weak, their ornaments not so reﬁned, and the countenance of the one on the right (the only countenance preserved) wears an almost fatuous expression. In the second and ﬁfth bays (nos. 33, 34=Pl. 152, a, b) the inferiority is still more marked. In each bay there are three seated Buddhas in the attitude of Teaching or of Meditation, and between them stand two Bodhisattvas. None of the ﬁgures, either seated or standing, has any pretention to artistic merit, let alone to spiritual beauty; they are merely stock types turned out, as it were, and repeated mechanically at so much a ﬁgure, as we shall see presently that thousands of miniature ﬁgures were repeated on the smaller stﬁpas. A typical specimen is the standing Bodhisattva on the right hand of panel 34, which is illustrated on a large scale on P1. I 55, 0. Setting it by the side of the corresponding ﬁgure of the central group, one can see at once how weak and ill-proportioned it is, the head and feet too big for the rest of the body, the features awry, the expression devoid of meaning, the ornaments and drapery clumsy and overdone. B. Detached heads, etc. Nos. 3 5—8.

Over the plaster is a ﬁne slip of lime or more probably ﬁne ‘shell’ plaster, applied before the ﬁnal deﬁnition was given to the features. The paste must have been still soft when the slip was put on, and it was not until after the application of the latter that the ﬁne lines were impressed with a modelling tool around the nostrils, etc. The face is left white, but the lips, edges of nostrils, rims and folds of eyelids, edges of hair, folds of neck and ear—lobes, are picked out in red, and the hair is coloured grey-black.

For variety and extent the collection of stucco ﬁgures found at the saughdrdma of Iauliaﬁ is by far the most important at Taxila. It does not contain anything up to the standard of the ﬁnest reliefs at Mohra Moradu, but, on the other hand, it comprises countless examples of every kind of ﬁgurine employed in the ﬁfth century to adorn the smaller class of stﬁpas.

In the centre is seated the Buddha in the attitude of Meditation (dhydna-mudrd) with a standing Buddha to his right and left and two attendant ﬁgures behind. Of the latter, the one to his right is carrying the ﬂy—whisk (caurz'); the other, as suggested by his head-dress, is Indra, holding the thunderbolt (vajm) in his left hand.

The central image, like all such large images of this period, is composed of a core of large blocks of kaﬁjﬁr stone covered with clay, and ﬁnished with a thick coating of lime stucco. The workmanship is rough and the style mechanical. (Pl. I 54, a.)",I 54-a,,,1927

This is probably one of the earliest of the smaller stﬁpas at Iauliaﬁ, and it'is not unlikely that the form of decoration found here represents an earlier stage than that found in most of the neighbouring stﬁpas (e.g. D I, D4, A16), but, if this is so, the images of the Buddha must have been remade in the ﬁfth century A.D. since it is quite certain that, as they stand, they are among the latest reliefs on the site, being both stereotyped in style and coarse in workmanship.

Stucco image of the Bodhisattva Maitreya, in the attitude of Meditation, holding an unguent-ﬂask in the ﬁngers of his left hand. Wears ear-pendants, necklaces and bangles. The state of preservation is excellent, but the modelling is mechanical and the features heavy and soulless. As a rule, Maitreya is seated in European fashion, and is seldom portrayed in the dhyana-mua'ra. Cf. p. 373 supra. (Pl. 1 5 5, d.) B. Small sculptures in situ. Nos. 43—8 (cf. ch. 20, pp. 372—3). These are found on a large class of stﬁpas at Iauliaﬁ and elsewhere. The stﬁpas commonly have a square base, circular drum, dome and a range of umbrellas, but from most of them the super— structure has now perished and the bases only remain. The latter are generally divided into three horizontal tiers, diminishing in width and height as they ascend, and divided one from the other by dentil cornices. The principle of decoration is the same for all three tiers; it consists of a series of stunted pilasters with shallow niches between them. In the two lower tiers the pilasters are usually in the debased Corinthian style; in the uppermost, in the debased Persepolitan. The niches are in the form either of a trefoil arch or of a portal with sloping jambs, which was the form in fashion at this time for the doorways of monastery cells. These two forms of niches alternate with one another on the faces of the stﬁpas, both horizontally and verti- cally. Within the niches are seated Buddhas or Bodhisattvas—the former in the attitude either of Meditation or of Teaching; on either side of the niches, between them and the pilasters, are pairs of ﬁgures bringing offerings to or worshipping the Buddha. In order to increase the height of the two lower tiers without diminishing the number of niches, an extra row of ﬁgures was added at their base. Inthe lowest tiers these ﬁgures commonly consisted of the forefronts of lions alternating with atlantes, which are shown supporting the weight of the superstructure above them. In the second tier the lions were frequently replaced by elephants. CH. 26] STUCCO SCULPTURES 525 To the above description it should be added that: (a) In the second and top tiers the forefronts of lions and elephants were sometimes added at the base of the portal jambs and trefoil arches which enclosed the niches. (b) The Perse- politan pilaster—capitals were usually crowned with bulls, back to back. (0) The atlantes generally took the form of warriors or musicians or ﬁgures holding wine— cups. (d) The ﬁgures beside the Buddha rest, as a rule, on a kind of lotus stool. Sometimes they are two Buddhas, seated and meditating; sometimes they are two monks or two lay-worshippers, kneeling and praying or bringing offerings of fruit or ﬂowers in their robes or in a basket, or occasionally with caskets in their hands, containing treasures of one kind or another (no. 43=Pl. 156, a). (e) Figures of seated Buddha are sometimes substituted on the face of the Corinthian pilasters in place of the usual small incised panels, e.g. on the pilasters on the west face of stﬁpa D4 (no. 44=Pl. 154, b). The above was the scheme of decoration on the majority of these small stﬁpas, but in some cases it was varied by inserting a row of seated Buddhas or Bodhisattvas side by side and without any adventitious decoration beneath the lowest course of lions and atlantes, as in stﬁpa A11. In a few cases, as in A15, the whole plinth was occupied by such ﬁgures, but as already stated, this may represent an earlier type of decoration. Such intensive repetition of ﬁgures is not found in stﬁpas of the earlier Gandhara School. The new fashion was to some extent the result of the stereotyping and commercialising of art; but it arose still more from the ever-growing practice of repeating the ﬁgures of the Blessed One in countless numbers, so that the donor of them might achieve a corresponding increase in the volume of his merit. The general appearance of these stﬁpa-bases will be clear from the illustrations of stﬁpas A16 and D4 (nos. 45—7) on Pls. 156 and 157. The former, which is the smaller of the two, is now in the local museum; the latter still stands on the spot where it was unearthed. Although the description given above applies accurately to both, there are certain features that merit further attention. One of these is that, while in stﬁpa A 16 all the ﬁgures in the niches are Buddhas seated in the attitude of Teaching or of Contemplation, in theupper section of D4 as well as in D1, Bodhisattvas are substituted for some of the Buddhas. Another noteworthy feature is the sloppy and unconvincing postures of the atlantes, not only on these, but on all the stﬁpas of this period. It is a natural and logical expectation that any supporting ﬁgures of the kind, whether atlantes or caryatids or animals, should be sufﬁciently big and strong to appear to support the super- incumbent weight; but these atlantes are not only absurdly small in proportion to the size of the structure, but they are in attitudes which suggest that, instead of sustaining the mass above them, they are being crushed beneath its burden. A third point of interest is that among the many pairs of attendants on the Buddhas or the Bodhisattvas we encounter here and there some women. One such pair of women occurs in a panel in the lower row on the north face of stﬁpa D4 (no. 48=Pl. 154, c). In the centre, is a meditating Buddha, and to right‘and left of his trefoil niche a woman seated on a high seat in European fashion. The one to MT 57 Buddhas 526 STUCCO SCULPTURES [CH. 26 the proper right of the Buddha holds in both hands a covered vessel, the bottom of which rests on her left hand, while with her right hand she seems about to lift off the tall lid. The other one holds in her right hand a drinking-cup and in her left a spear. These are distinguishing attributes of Kubera, the dispenser of riches, in his capacity of leader of the yakshas, and later on were transferred to his consort Hariti, the demon mother of children and giver of prosperity. We may be sure, therefore, that these women are meant to be yakshinis, embodying some popular superstition or other.I Hariti herself, so the legend goes, was converted by the Buddha and became an updsikd or lay-disciple; and to feed her 500 children, whom she had formerly fed on the ﬂesh of human children, Buddha told her that the bhikshus in the monasteries should every day offer her food from their portions. Hence, I—tsing tells us, an image of Hariti was placed either in the porch or in the corner of the dining—hall of Indian monasteries, and abundant offerings of food were made to it.z C.

The hair is treated in much the same way as on the small head from Mohra Moradu (no. 35 supra) but the features are not so reﬁned and delicate as in that example.

Unfortunately, the ushnz'sha is missing and the nose and ear-lobes are damaged. There is a bull slip and traces of red paint on lips and eyes, and of black paint on the hair and eyebrows. (P1. 153, b.) The remaining Buddha heads from Jauliaﬁ, illustrated on P1. 158, are much inferior in style and execution to the preceding, but they are the work of various hands and represent several characteristic types of which there are many more examples at Taxila. Thus, no. 52 belongs to a class of heads which are distinguished by a rather small chin and largish mouth, with the underlip deﬁned by a simple curve at the lower edge, giving a slightly supercilious look to the face. In this type, too, both the upper and lower eyelids are bordered by simple instead of reﬂex curves, and, as a rule, the cheek—bones are wide and pronounced, though more so in other examples than in the one illustrated. No. 53 on the other hand, has a narrower face with higher forehead, more rounded cheeks and a small mouth, which imparts to it a rather insipid and soulless expression; and the same remarks 1 Cf. Foucher in juulidﬁ Mem. p. 28. 2 Cf. Grunwedel, Buddhist Art in India, p. 105.

Below, on the face of the plinth, are four other small ﬁgures, of which the one near the head is a Dhyani Buddha, and the one near the feet a devotee kneeling with folded hands. The two central ﬁgures appear to have swooned with grief at the sight of their dying Master. This is the only stucco panel from this part of India which depicts the Buddha’s death-scene.

But observe the inordinate height of the forehead and the relative smallness of the eyes, nose and mouth.
