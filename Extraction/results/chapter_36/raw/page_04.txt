702 STONE SCULPTURES [CH. 36

7. Standing male ﬁgure of grey Taraki sandstone in the same massive style as the preceding
but perhaps a little earlier. Height 26-25 in. The ﬁgure wears a tunic tied by a cord at the
waist and reaching to the knees, long shawl or himation, high boots and necklace(?). The high
boots suggest that it may represent Sﬁrya, the Sun—god, whose temple is said by Philostratus
(Life of Apollom'us, II, 24) to have stood in the city of Sirkap, where the statue was found. Like
no. 6, the statue, although free-standing, is treated as much like an alto rilievo as a ﬁgure in
the round. The right forearm, which was attached by means of a tenon and socket, is missing,
and the head is defaced. The hair is arranged in the same wig-like fashion as on no. 4 and
other ﬁgures of the early Gandhara School. The peculiar treatment of the drapery, which falls
in loose folds round the shoulder and arms and stands out on either side of the hips, recalls
that on certain coins of Azes I. (BM. Cat. Pl. XIX, I.) Probable date, latter part of ﬁrst
century B.C. Sk. ’16—A739; stratum II. Cf. pp. 694—5 supra. (Pl. 212, no. 7.)

8. Bracket of chloritised mica schist in the form of a winged male ﬁgure, with hands in front
of breast, possibly holding some object. Height 4-7 5 in. The ﬁgure wears bangles, necklaces and
shawl, which is drawn across the back and through both arms, leaving the front of the body
bare. On the head is a broad—tasselled bandeau. The feet and ankles are missing. Observe
the rough heavy character of the modelling and the careless workmanship; also the formal
treatment of the folds of the shawl, as in other ﬁgures of this period. Such brackets as this one
and nos. 11, 12 and 16—21 were commonly used to adorn the domes of stﬁpas near their base.
(Foucher, A.G—B.G. I, p. 59, ﬁg. 12.) Early Gandhara School. First half of ﬁrst century A.D.
Sk. ’27—83; Block E’; sq. 75'93’; stratum I. Cf. p. 184 supra. (Pl. 212, no. 8.)

9. Standing male winged ﬁgure in semi-relief, of chloritised mica schist. Height 4'7 5 in.
Wears scarf in same manner as preceding, leaving the front of the body nude. The two hands
are raised in front of breast, holding uncertain object (P bird). The head is missing. The ﬁgure
is of heavy proportions, coarsely modelled and carelessly ﬁnished. Early Gandhara School.
Probable date, ﬁrst half of ﬁrst century A.D. Sk. ’14—164; Block D’; sq. 60'77’; stratum I.
Cf. p. 191 supra. (Pl. 213, no. 9.)

IO. Standing male ﬁgure in the round, of chloritised mica schist. Height 7-37 in. Wears
bangles, necklace and scarf in same manner as nos. 8 and 9, leaving front of body bare. Hands
raised in front of breast, the left hand holding bird. Head and parts of legs missing. Although
the ﬁgure is in the round, the back is ﬂat and unmodelled. Early Gandhara School. Same date
as preceding. Cf. p. 147 supra; A.S.R. (1924), P1. XII, 9. Sk. ’24—481; Block B; sq. 37-44’;
stratum II. (Pl. 213, no. 10.)

11. Volute bracket of pale chloritised mica schist in the form of a winged male ﬁgure
springing at the hips from an acanthus leaf base. Length 6-62 in. The ﬁgure wears a sleeved
tunic, shawl and Indian turban and cylindrical ear-ornaments of Indian design. His two hands
are raised in adoration in front of his breast. On the back and tenon of the bracket is a Kharosh-
thi inscription: Savatrateua m'yatito vihare matapitu puyae Devadato = ‘Presented by Sarvatrata
in the Vihara, in honour of his mother and father, Devadatta’. The letters are said by Prof.
Konow to be of about the same age as the inscriptions on the silver vessels from Sirkap (‘ Silver-
ware’, ch. 29, nos. 2, 10, I3, 19), i.e. c. A.D. 30-4o—a date which is also borne out by the
ﬁndspot and style. Early Gandhara School. Observe the characteristic treatment of the
drapery, arranged in schematic folds. Cf. p. 171 supra; A.S.R. (1926), p. 118, no. 8 and
P1. XXVIII, 9; Ep. Ind. vol. 11, pp. 99—100, and P1. XIX. Sk. ’26—1,457; Block J; sq. 148-51’;
stratum II. (Pl. 213, no. 11.)

12. Seated, herm—like male ﬁgure of chloritised mica schist. The ﬁgure, which served
perhaps as a bracket, wears a shawl over both shoulders, necklace and heavy ear-rings. The
right hand is half raised, holding a bowl; the left is apparently resting on the seat. Height
4-62 in. Early Gandhara School. First half of ﬁrst century A.D. Sk. ’16—1,16o; Block C;
sq. 42-63’; stratum II. Cf. p. 148 supra. (Pl. 213, no. 12.) _

13. Head in high relief, of chloritised mica schist. Height 3-12 in. In place of hair, the face
