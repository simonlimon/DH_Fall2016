CH. 36] STONE SCULPTURES 703

is framed in a wig-like head-dress of lotus leaves like no. 161 (41.71.). For the round, staring eyes,
characteristic of the earliest Gandhara sculptures, see pp. 693—4 supra, and cf. nos. 3, 4, 1 3 5;
also ‘Stone Objects’, ch. 25, nos. 63, 64, 66, 7o, 74, etc. Sk. ’24-791; Block C; sq. 46-46’;
stratum III. Cf. p. 149, no. 8 supra. (Pl. 213, no. 13.)

14.. Fountain-head of chloritised mica schist in form of grotesque male Kubera-like ﬁgure,
seated cross-legged on thin rectangular base. Height 5-87 in. The ﬁgure wears curly beard
and moustache and bracelet on right wrist. There are holes in mouth, ears, navel and top of
head for the discharge of water. Early Gandhara School. First half of ﬁrst century AD. Cf.
p. 167 supra; A.S.R. (1926), p. 118, no. 16. Sk. ’26—3,398; Block H; sq. 120-49'; stratum II.
(Pl. 213, no. 14.)

I 5. Makara head in relief of Taraki sandstone, possibly from a pediment. Height 11-5 in.
Two sides are slightly curved and the back has been scooped into a bowl. Like nos. 6 and 7,
local Taxilan work. Probable date, between 50 B.C. and AD. 50. Dh. ’15—1,o71. From out-
lying debris.

16. Volute bracket of quartz schist in the form of a winged female ﬁgure springing at the
hips from an acanthus leaf base. Length 13-5 in. The ﬁgure wears a close—ﬁtting, long-sleeved
garment, large circular ear-ornaments, bracelet, ornamented torque and long ﬂexible necklace
falling between the breasts. The hands hold in front of the body an offering, seemingly of fruit.
Anarrow taenia across the forehead allows a ﬂat schematic dressing of the hair on the brow, but
above this the elaborately treated hair falls backward to the shoulders. There is a circular
ornament in the centre of the hair above the ﬁllet. The style is early Gandharan but not so
early as the brackets from Sirkap. Probable date, second half of ﬁrst century AD. Cf. no. 11
supra. This bracket and no. 17 infra, as well as two others of similar style and of the same stone,
are probably from the same structure. Dh. ’17—97; mon. court A; 3 ft. 6 in. below surface.

Cf. p. 278 supra; A.S.R. (1917), P1. IV, 1). (Pl. 213, no. 16.)

17. Volute bracket of quartz schist in the form of a winged male ﬁgure springing at the ,

waist from an acanthus leaf base. Length I 1-12 in. A loose scarf passes over the left shoulder,
its lower end hidden by the acanthus foliage. The arms and features are defaced, as is part of
the head-dress, bound above the forehead by a ﬁllet with centre ornament, above which rises
an acanthus leaf merging into the volute. The latter takes the form of a bundle of logs(?)——
a motif commonly adopted for the capitals of pillars in the early rock-hewn temples of Western
India. The ﬁgure wears an ornamented collar and torque, which passes over the scarf at the
shoulder. The style is early Gandharan and this sculpture is seemingly from the same structure
as no. 16 (qxv) Dh. ’30—213; mon. court H; sq. 28-20’; 2 ft. 9in. below surface. Cf. p. 286,
no. 5 supra.

18. Winged male bracket ﬁgure of mica schist springing at the thighs from an acanthus leaf.
Length 7‘ 5 in. The ﬁgure wears a dhotz‘, scarf and turban with a large central ornament, heavy
ear-rings, jewelled collar and long ﬂexible necklace. The left hand grasps the scarf hanging
over the left shoulder, the right hand rests on the hip. The voluted bracket against which the
ﬁgure leans is fashioned to resemble a serpent with scaly surface and double head. Kunala;
cell E8; 1 ft. above ﬂoor-level. Cf. p. 352 supra. (Pl. 213, no. 18.)

19. Bracket of phyllite in the form of a standing ﬁgure rising from the knees behind the
forepart of a winged bull. Length 925 in. The garments, a dhotz‘ and scarf, suggest a male
personage. The only ornaments are a jewelled necklace and bracelets. The hands, now lost,
appear to have been clasped on the breast. A much-defaced acanthus leaf embellished the chest
of the bull, the head being almost in the round, though the incurved horns are in relief. Kn. ’32—

292; outside B 28; 10 ft. below surface. Cf. p. 340 supra. (P1. 213, no. 19.)
20. Bracket of mica schist bearing the much—defaced head of an elephant, of which only

traces remain. Dh. ’15—973; mon. court A; 7 ft. below surface. Cf. p. 278 supra.
21. Fragment of bracket of mica schist bearing the head of a bull. Length 5 in. Dh. ’17—1 5;

mon. court A; 4. ft. 6 in. below surface. Cf. p. 278 supra.
