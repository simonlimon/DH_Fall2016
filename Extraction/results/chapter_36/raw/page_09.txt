CH. 36] STONE SCULPTURES 707

design, now somewhat defaced, of vine stems arranged in roughly circular form, the interior
spaces being ﬁlled with vine leaves and bunches of grapes, the exterior with bunches of grapes
or tendrils. Dh. ’16—193; north of Q1; 3 ft. below surface.

53. Cornice of phyllite. Length 26-75 in. On face, running vine scroll embellished with
leaves and tendrils, between raised ﬁllets; above, ﬂat bead-and-reel moulding. Dh. ’13—205;

M3; 5 ft. below surface. Cf. p. 258 supra. (P1. 215, no. 53.)

54. Fragment of phyllite cornice. Length 14-5 in. Below a broad ﬁllet is a frieze of acanthus
leaves; above, a narrow ﬁllet and bead—and-reel moulding. Cf. A.G—B.G. ﬁg. I I 5. Dh. ’12—89;
D5; 4 ft. below surface. Cf. p. 24.9 supra.

55. Fragment of phyllite frieze. Length 4-7 5 in. Between two broad ﬁllets is an undulating
pipal stem with offshoots in roughly circular form as in no. 53 supra, the enclosed spaces each
containing three pipal leaves. Pipal leaves springing from the encircling stems ﬁll the exterior
spaces between the stems and ﬁllets. Cf. A.G—B.G. ﬁg. 95. Mm. ’27—30; south side of
stﬁpa II. Cf. p. 362, no. 5 supra.

56. Fragment of phyllite frieze. Length 5-75 in. Enframed in a broad, plain edging is an
undulating ﬂoral scroll of conventionalised honeysuckle pattern. Dh. ’12—1,o59; between L
and D3; 2 ft. 5 in. below surface. Cf. p. 251 supra.

57. Fragment of phyllite frieze. Length 8-25 in. Framed in a plain, ﬂat edging is an un-
dulating vine stem, with large leaf ﬁlling each of the spaces above and below the undulations.
Cf. no. 56 supra. Dh. ’12—3 58; between L and D5; 4 ft. below surface. Cf. p. 251 supra.

58. Fragment of phyllite frieze. Length 887 in. A projecting border at the bottom is
adorned with a saw-tooth moulding, two ﬁllets, a beaded moulding and a bead—and-reel
moulding. Above this border the face of the frieze is embellished with an elaborate, but
crudely executed design of unusual form. Its most striking feature is a row of peacocks, of
which two only are preserved, standing en face with outspread tails. Around each is a beaded
lozenge and leaf ornament, and between them is an uncommon design of two slightly converging
bands made up of two ﬁllets enclosing beading and crossed horizontally by a double beading
and a cylinder, through which the heading seems to pass. In the lower division is a conven-
tional ﬂower; in the upper, a crescent supporting eglantine. On the left are traces of beaded
lozenges and foliage but different from the ornament between the peacocks. Both design and
technique are uncommon and the lavish use of beading suggests extraneous inﬂuence. Such
beading is a familiar feature of the early Gupta art of Hindustan. Dh. ’13—698; N4; 3 ft. 6 in.
below surface.

59. Triangular relief of phyllite. Length 11-62 in. On lower edge, roll and stepped base
moulding; on right, bevelled pilaster. In the triangular space and facing right is a spirited
relief of a cock with long hackles. Cf. A.G-B.G. ﬁgs. I 19—23. Akhauri (Chir Tope B) ’21—84;

6o. Fragment of phyllite with ﬁgure in high relief of a winged dragon, the body in coils,
the underside scaly, the ends of the double tail treated as if of foliage. The slightly opened
mouth displays saw-like teeth. Length 10-5 in. For the winged dragon, cf. Pl. 145, nos. 77,
83—6, and P1. 146, no. 88. Dh. ’12—C 218. (P1. 215, no. 60.)

61. Fragment of voluted end of bracket. Cf. ﬁg. 18 and A.G-B.G. ﬁg. 47. Of phyllite. The

Behind A 12; 4 ft. below surface.

62. Panel of mica schist with three standing, naked amorini (yakshas). The one in the centre
