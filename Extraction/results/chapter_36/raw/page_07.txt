standing haloed ﬁgure With the left arm tensely extended by the side are now preserved. For
its base the pilaster has a square-stepped pedestal supporting a water-pot.I The shaft is round
and tapering and between it and the capital is a necking of three projecting ﬁllets. The capital
is bell—shaped with mushroom dome above. The surface of the bell is adorned with acanthus
leaves reversed.2 A slight roughness of the surface of the shaft may indicate the former existence
of a relief such as can be seen in nos. 38 and 39. Between the main relief and the pilaster is a
beaded moulding. Dh. ’16—792; G4; 3 ft. below surface. Cf. p. 257, no. 3 supra. (Pl. 215, no. 37.)

is embellished by a naked little yaksha standing on a roughly indicated lotus, with left hand
on hip, the right holding ﬂowers(?). The bell capital is decorated with acanthus leaves and

I This type of base (adishzhana) is common in monuments of the Early Indian School. Sometimes

we ﬁnd the stepped pedestal alone; sometimes the water—pot Without the pedestal. U. M.]
