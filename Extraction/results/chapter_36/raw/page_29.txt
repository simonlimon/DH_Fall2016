CH. 36] STONE SCULPTURES 727

I84. Headless female ﬁgure, of potstone, in quasi-relief, shown seated in European fashion
on a lion throne. Wears a tunic conﬁned by jewelled waist-band and leaving the left breast bare.
Below the waist, heavy voluminous drapery swathes the legs and conceals the feet. Right hand
lost. In the left, which rests on the thigh, is what is probably intended for a cornucopia, the
narrow twisted end against the shoulder; the wider, bottom end resting in the hand resembles
the head of a makara and is suggestive of a rhyton. This may be meant for Hariti. Cf. nos. I
and 3 supra and also A.G—B.G. ﬁgs. 386—9. Height 4-87 in. Dh. ’34—1.

185. Standing male ﬁgure of ﬁne-grained grey stone, in low relief. In easy attitude, with
the weight of the body on left leg, and the right crossing it in front. The elbow of the bent right
arm rests on the head of a defaced dwarf or gaua, which stands on a defaced object, probably an
animal. The body is naked to the waist save for a necklace, breast-chain and narrow scarf over
left arm. Of the lower garment only a narrow band round the loins and a long tail-like piece
falling between the legs are indicated. The ear is long with pendulous and pierced lobe, lacking
ear-ring. Behind the head is what may be intended for a halo, against which ﬂoats the decorated
end of a diadem or the ribbon of the high crown—like head-dress, as on certain Sasanian coins
and sculptures. Height 4-5 in. Probably of fourth to ﬁfth century AD. Cf. p. 278 supra;
A.S.R. (1915—16), p. 7, no. 14. Dh. ’I5—I,027; mon. court A.

Buddha, showing two, standing, headless Buddha ﬁgures. Both have the rather large right

189. Haloed, princely ﬁgure of Bodhisattva type from right of a relief. Face half—left, feet

backward and the end of the scarf ﬂying outwards from the left arm. Right arm and left hand
lost; features partially obliterated. Wears high head—dress, long plain necklace and ear-ring,
seemingly of thin metal with leaf terminals. Of phyllite. Height 7 in. Dh. ’14—211; P2; 2 ft.

192. Fragment from left of relief showing head and chest of Vajrapani, of bearded Jovian
type. He faces half-right and grasps in right hand the upper half of a vajra. Above, to his

sattva ﬁgure. Cf. no. 174 supra. Possibly from a representation of the Renunciation. Of
