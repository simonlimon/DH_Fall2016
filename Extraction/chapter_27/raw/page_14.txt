546 IRON OBJECTS [CH. 27

62, a. Dagger blade, double-edged without midrib. Much corroded. Length 9-4 in.
Medium or low carbon material, severely decarburised on the surface. Sk. ’12—96. First

century A.D. Stratum II. Cf. Table of Analysis, p. 536, no. 3.

CLASS XIX. Spears, javelins and butt (nos. 63—71)

Taxila has yielded several types of these weapons, viz.: (a) four-sided pike-head
with tang (no. 63), third to second century B.C.; (1)) heavy iron javelin, resembling
the {10065 of the cataphracts (nos. 64—6), third to second century B.C.(P) and ﬁrst
century A.D.; (c) leaf-blade spear—head with central ridge and tang (no. 68), ﬁrst
century A.D. ; (d) socketed spear—head of dagger- or knife—blade pattern (nos. 69—70),
ﬁrst and ﬁfth century A.D.; (e) socketed conical spear—butt (no. 71), ﬁfth century
A.D. Most interesting of these are the heavy javelins of type (b). The only specimen
found in the Bhir Mound has a three-ﬂanged head; two from Sirkap, ﬁrst century
A.D., have four—ﬂanged heads. The former may possibly be a stray, but in any case
there seems little doubt that these metal javelins were a foreign weapon introduced
either by the Bactrian Greeks or, more probably, by the Sakas or Parthians.
Whether, like the Roman pilum, they were provided with a wooden butt or handle
there is no evidence to show.

Type a:

63. Spike—shaped spear-head of iron, four-sided with tang for ﬁxing into wooden shaft.
Length 7' 5 in. Roughly made, but of great penetrating power against plate or mail armour.

Third to second century B.C. Bm. ’19—505; sq. 29'56’; stratum I. Cf. Analysis Table, p. 536,
no. 10. (Pl. 164, no. 63.) ,

Type I):

64. Heavy iron javelin with shaft and head in one piece. Length 3875 in., but the shaft is 7

broken. The head is three—ﬂanged, like the arrow-heads of type c, below. Third to second
century B.C., unless, as seems probable, it is a stray of later date. Bm.; stratum II.
65. Similar to preceding, but with four-ﬂanged head. Shaft broken. Length 25 in.
Sk. ’22—«828; Fifth Street (west); sq. 53-85’; stratum II. First century A.D. (Pl. 164, no. 65.)
66. Similar to no. 65 and from same ﬁndspot. Shaft broken. Length 22 in.; stratum II.

(Pl. 164, no. 66.)
67. Javelin-head of narrow leaf pattern, with shaft of same metal; broken. Length 6- 5 in.

This may belong to the same class of heavy javelin as the three preceding specimens, but
we cannot be sure on the point as only 3 in. of the shaft are preserved. It is referable to the
ﬁfth century A.D. Mm. ’15—42; mon., north steps; 5 ft. below surface. Cf. p. 363 (I8) supra.

(Pl. 164, no. 67.)

Type c:

68. Leaf-shaped spear-head, with central ribbing on both sides; tang broken. Length
8-25 in. Sk. ’26—1,213; Block]; sq. 145-57’; stratum II. First century A.D. Cf. p. 171 supra.
(P1. 164, no. 68.)

Type d:

69., Dagger-shaped spear-head with hollow socket (broken). Length 7-12 in. Sk. ’15—487;
Block G; sq. 114-49'; stratum II. First century A.D. Cf. p. 169 supra. (Pl. 164, no. 69.)

7o. Socketed spear-head of knife-blade pattern. Length 11-87 in. Fifth century A.D.
In. ’16—273; cell no. 3; I ft. below surface. Cf. p. 385 supra. (P1. 164, no. 70.)
