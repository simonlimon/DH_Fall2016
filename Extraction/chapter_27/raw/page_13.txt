CH. 27] IRON OBJECTS ‘ 545

Kanishka at Mathura the king is shown grasping a long straight sword which seems
to have been of this type (cf. Bachhofer, Early Indian Sculpture, Pl. LXXVI).
Similar swords are also sometimes depicted in carvings of the Early Indian School
(e.g. Cunningham, Bharhut, Pl. XXXII, 4), but the sword more usually depicted in
these carvings as well as in the Gandhara reliefs is a short weapon like the Roman
gladius. Cf. Dar. et Sag. 3.7). ‘Gladius’ and ‘Spatha’ and ﬁgs. 6522 and 6523.
Strabo (XV, 67) and Arrian (Ind. 16) state that in the fourth century B.C. the Indian
soldier carried a broadsword three cubits in length, and Arrian adds that he
wielded it with both hands. No weapons of this description have been found.

Of the daggers, one only (no. 59) comes from the Bhir Mound and is referable
to the third to second century B.C.; the others (nos. 60—2) are referable to the ﬁrst
century A.D. Except in the matter of length they closely resemble the swords and
might well have answered to the term semispathium, applied to the Roman pugio in
later Imperial times. The earlier specimen (no. 59) differs from the later ones in
that the blade is straight—edged almost up to the point where it tapers abruptly,
and that there is no cross—guard attached to it at the hilt.

56. Double—edged sword. Length including tang 34-25 in. The blade, which is straight-
edged on both sides, tapers gradually to a point. In section it is lozenge-shaped and bevelled
evenly on either side from the midrib to the edge. Attached to the heel of the blade is a
cross-guard shod with bronze. Of the hilt only the tang remains. Sk. ’14; Trench A626;
stratum II. (P1. 164, no. 56.)

57. Similar and of same date, but broken towards the point. Of high carbon steel. Present
length I 5 in. The blade is ﬂatter than in the preceding specimen and Without midribs.
Lozenge-shaped guard; tang pierced with two holes for attachment of grip and pommel.
Sk. ’16—229; Block E’; sq. 71-76’; stratum II. Cf. p. 185, and Analysis Table, p. 536, no. I
supra. (Pl. 164, no. 57.)

58. Similar to preceding and of same date. Length 21 in. Blade convex in section on both
sides. Sk. ’26—4,43o; Block L; sq. 190-69’; stratum II. (Pl. 164, no. 58.)

58, a. Broken blade of steel sword. The blade, which tapers gradually towards the point,
is without midribs. Length 99 in. Date uncertain, but probably ﬁfth century A.D. For
Brinell hardness, analysis and micro-examination, see Analysis Table, p. 536, no. 2. Chir
